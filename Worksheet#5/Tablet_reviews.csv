"2","Tablet","Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet (newest model) built for relaxation, 10.1 vibrant Full HD screen, octa-core processor, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB, Black","GooseGirl","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024","One for me and one for my niece!","I just checked and found that this 10"" tablet is my 11th Kindle Fire tablet since 2011, so you may say I'm a fan! My husband gets my hand-me-downs, and since had I just bought a new 10"" tablet back in February (ocean), he now gets that one and I get the new one (lilac). So we're both happy. We mostly use our tablets for reading, and for that purpose, they work great. This 10-inch tablet is a nice size, not too heavy for reading or browsing the internet. Overall, it is a nice looking tablet at a good price and does what I need it to do. That being said, there are some limitations:1) I'm not much of a gamer, but some years back, I got a few games for free on a Black Friday sale and enjoyed playing them. I also downloaded another game that is free to play. All three of these games worked great until I got to end-game. I then had problems with the game slowing down and even freezing to the point where I was unable to play them to the finish. I tried adding extra storage, even going so far as buying a newer tablet, but ultimately realized that it was a RAM issue. It's disappointing to me that games would be sold in the Amazon Appstore when the RAM on the tablet wouldn't be able to support the demands of the game. There is an upside: I stopped playing them and now have more time to read, yay!2) Even though my tablet is new, it is becoming more and more apparent that Amazon is no longer supporting some of its own apps. These apps are no longer working (although the sites themselves can still be accessed using the Silk Browser): Goodreads, which Amazon owns, so this is really a mystery, especially because so many people do use their tablets for reading; and both the Shop Amazon and the Photos app now take you to the Silk Browser, where you need to sign in each time to access. In the case of the Photos app, it seems to have been replaced with the new Gallery app, but as of this date, Gallery is extremely limited in function. To use a new photo wallpaper, for example, I had to click on the Photos app, sign in, find and download locally the picture I wanted to use, and only then could the innate wallpaper chooser ""see"" the photo, which was also then available in Gallery. Whew! Prior to this change, the wallpaper could be easily changed in one step, as Amazon Photos was one of the choices, along with the built-in wallpapers, and you could scroll and select a photo as desired.If you're not an end-gamer or don't really need or rely on the built-in Amazon apps, you'll be fine, as this is still a more than decent tablet for the price.",5,NA

This one works great and so far it does everything I want it to do. The touch screen is responsive and it is easy to connect to my home WiFi. It is easy to charge with the provided wire and wall adapter, and so far the battery is holding a charge for quite a long time. I have been able to use the app store to download apps, I have read books using Kindle and Libby, and I have also used it for basic activities such as games and surfing the internet. The screen is clear and graphics and photos look great. In fact, I'm writing this review with it and using the vocal dictation feature now. I have not used it yet to take pictures. I definitely recommend getting a good Protective case and Screen protector  For this tablet, because it is thin, sleek, and somewhat slippery. It might not be the fanciest one on the market, but I am very happy with it so far so far, especially for the price.",5,NA

"5","Tablet","Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet (newest model) built for relaxation, 10.1 vibrant Full HD screen, octa-core processor, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB, Black","Helen K Jones","Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","","Being a senior newbie in ownership of the first tablet ever, I really like this tablet.  I've had it now a month and being disabled, I have been using it faithfully every day for many many hours per day. Since I've never had a tablet before I can't really compare it to another.But, there are a couple of issues I have been having and don't know if this is normal behavior for a tablet or not.First issue that is really bothered to me is that after watching a lot of videos from streaming most of the day that suddenly the videos start getting ""choppy."" This means that I'll be watching a video and it hits a snag and stalls briefly and then starts up and continues to do this nonstop.  It gets so irritating that I have to stop watching videos completely and turn the tablet off.  No, this isn't a WiFi buffer issue.  I have a similar issue with my flat screen TV because it's not a Smart TV, and it's older.  With the TV, though, I'm lucky if I can watch more than a movie before the subtitles go off sync with the video and have to restart.  I'm suspecting that the video stalling issue might be other than the tablet, but don't know for sure.  But, I'll have watched videos most of a day before this stalling starts to happen.  Since I can't be certain if the issue is with the tablet and not the streaming service, I give the benefit to the tablet.The second issue is with the video selection on the tablet.  I'll have the screen with a bunch of squares of different videos to select from and when I select one on the screen, it responds by opening up something completely different that is on a different part of the screen.  Again, I don't know if this is a tablet issue for sure, but it is a little annoying when I'm trying to decide on what I want to watch next and something else pops up that I didn't select.  Also, when I'm watching a video, the tablet doesn't respond always when I touch it to pause it.  Again, don't know if this is a tablet issue or not.BUT, I love both the video and audio quality of the tablet.  I got the tablet for the purpose of watching my streaming videos and it's been a wonderful experience.  One thing that really pleasantly surprised me was the audio!!  Absolutely fantastic!  It's like having surround sound when watching videos!I got the case to go with the tablet as well and it's really nice.  It took me a bit to adjust to the case in maneuvering it in my bed when laying down, but it's satisfactory.  After all, these things aren't really designed with the disabled in mind.  But, it is a nice quality case cover for the tablet.  I have a few cats, so the case cover protects it very nicely against their tendencies to lay atop the tablet.  It's a good protection for falling off the bed when I've fallen asleep!So, for my first experience with a tablet, this is great.  Makes me wonder what took me so long to buy one!",5,NA

I have found them to be an excellent value for basic use - reading, web surfing, media playback and lightweight games.  I specifically do not use it as a laptop replacement or for hardcore gaming.  The 11"" screen is of an adequate size and the brightness and clarity are perfect for indoor use.  Mine has 128GB storage, which has the more useful upgrade of 8 GB RAM, which makes loading multiple programs much quicker.  There is a SD slot where you can add up to 1 TB, if you require it.The subjective speed of the A9+ is a little quicker than my older A8.  One useful throwback feature is that it has a real headphone jack if you happen to have a quality set of older headphones.  The built-in speakers are better than I would have thought - they are quite clear, but there is still no appreciable bass.Idle time battery life is somewhat less than I would have thought but this unit is still new and I haven't gone through that many charge cycles to sort out what is going on.  If you run the battery pretty far down, it can take a while to charge - about 4 hours from 10% to 100% using a Samsung phone charger.",5,NA
"15","Tablet","Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ Tablet 11” 64GB Android Tablet, Big Screen, Quad Speakers, Upgraded Chipset, Multi Window Display, Slim, Light, Durable Design, US Version, 2024, Graphite","Ron in Palm Springs","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2024","","I've been a computer user for many years (not an expert though) and I own a Samsung smart phone and laptop, so I'm not a novice to technology but I am for a tablet. It comes with a lot of bloatware, easily removed, and I was able to easily pair my phone settings to the tablet wirelessly - no problem. Haven't tried using the tablet as a phone yet but I probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside. So far I have enjoyed it, but I am disappointed that Samsung has sooooo many updates that consume a lot of time. I knew there would be a lot of updates when I first turned it on, but several days in I can still expect a Samsung update almost on a daily basis, and this is after I've done all the customizing that I want. Drives me nuts, so I encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to NOT do auto updates or you'll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something!  Do them on command or schedule them!  Samsung - get with it and bundle updates so they are less frequent, albeit more time consuming for each one. Other than that, apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good as are response times when moving from app to app or screen to screen. The battery life has been very good so far, and seems better than my cell phone. One thing I don't understand is why Samsung has offset the search bar on the home screen.....it is off center to the left on the screen no matter how I turn the device. Not a deal breaker but just looks very odd, if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen. The tablet is quite light, very thin, and the 10"" size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me. I especially like the touch keyboard that automatically displays with the Google search bar. Once I get past my learning curve, I'm sure I'll have more to say, but all in all, I'm mostly happy with the purchase.",5,NA

I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7, which I paid over $200 for, and have had Lenovo and Huawei tablets...For WAY less than half the price, I now have this tablet, which performs as well as, if not better than the others. I am VERY pleased! I've been using this URAO tablet for about 3 weeks now.To begin with, this URAO tablet came quickly, and the packaging was IMMACULATE!  Had about 85% charge, set up went quickly and smoothly, with ability to bring everything over from other tablets.  While I did not use that option, it was appreciated!  This tablet is just as advertised, and totally performs.The feel of the tablet is SOLID, no fault with its physical build at all.  It's quick in operation with all apps, battery longevity is as described, no issues there, charges quickly.I have noticed that WIFI reception is noticeably better than my other tablets as far as distance from the modem goes, which is a good thing.  Seriously, the ONLY negative about this tablet, to me, is that it REALLY needs to have a good screen protector, the reason being is that, again for me, something about the way the naked screen feels when I swipe to type, or scroll, it seems to be a skittery FEEL.  That was fixed completely by putting on a good screen protector - now it feels perfectly normal, smooth, and the touch sensitivity has not been affected at all by that addition. As a note, I would have put a screen protector on it anyway.One other mention is the resolution...while it IS HD 1280x800, the last two tablets I have purchased are FHD, which is noticeable to me.  But certainly NOT a deal-breaker, at that price.Now, while the TABLET is STELLAR, particularly for the price, there are a couple of disappointments...I do wish there had been a folio case paired with the purchase to consider.  I see nothing.  A case, to me, is a requirement, for protection from drops, etc.  I was able to adapt my old Lenovo case, simply by using double-sided sticky tape on the back of the URAO, and affixing it to the inside of my old case.  Not perfect, but usable.I also wish that there had been a recommended screen protector.  I went out and purchased a 10.1 diagonal, which is just a skosh larger than the screen, so there is overlap. A 10.0 diagonal might be a better shot for anyone wishing to do what I did and add that.*** UPDATE***It's been several weeks, now, and I'm happy to report in looking around again, I HAVE found BOTH a screen protector AND a case for this tablet...links belowhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH2WL1P8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_titlehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH382VH7?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title====================================================================There is one annoying aspect of using this tablet... it is NOT the tablet itself, but Android 14 seems to be significantly different in the way some things work from the Android 12 I am used to.  BUT...I am working through that.  That's on me....This is a GREAT buy, I am TOTALLY happy with the tablet and the purchase. You will be, too...I waffled about making the purchase, simply because I am pretty much a brand name buyer when it comes to electronics, but this is awesome.  It had a lot of verified purchaser high star ratings, few low ratings, the seller had great ratings, and I took a chance.  Yay for me!",5,NA

If you clear your caches frequently and/or turn it off often (daily), it clears the RAM and then it works better. It's still on the slow side with only 30% of the storage full, and I'll be upgrading when I can.On the enumerated items below:1. Less of a problem.2. Less of a problem when you learn where to touch.3. Still a big problem.4. See above.===============I purchased this tablet because it had a more current Android version. (Be careful! Some of the others had 4.4 when this one was 10.0!) Unfortunately...1. The screen is lacking responsiveness and drops the contact midway when swiping around (think of a word game where you have to swipe between letters).2. It's very difficult to initiate a touch. If an ad has an X to close, it can take many attempts to actually engage the X instead of going to Google Play to download the app being advertised.3. The screen has a funny feel, and after using a brand-new stylus for 48 hours, there are light but permanent scratches in the screen. (!!!!!) (Fingers are better.)4. It's slow and can't handle some more complicated games, such as a parking lot puzzle game with figures guarding exits.Granted, the tablet's cost was less than $100, but still... I needed a tablet right away and I guess it will work for basic things (I haven't tried it yet with Zoom), but I'll be replacing it as soon as I can afford a better one.",2,NA

The tablet is thin and light, it doesn't look cheap or low quality, but it is way too light makes you wonder if the tablet is made of pure plastic. It feels much better after putting on the silicon gel protector. I got the feeling the plastic stand in the back of the silicon gel will break soon, but we will see. The charging port is USB-C, which is a big plus. The tablet did not come with a charger, only a USB to USB-C charging cable. It charges fine in the USB port on my extension power strip and the USB charger came with an iPhone or Amazon Fire stick. The battery lasts about 4-5 hours, which is not bad at all.CPU model is indeed SC7731E, but it Quad-Core ARM Cortex A7 runs at 1.3GHz instead of Quad-Core ARM CortexTM A55 MP8 at 1.4GHz stated in the description. Total RAM is 2Gb instead of 3Gb in description and internal storage is indeed 64Gb. Screen size 10.1 1280x800 resolution as stated. GPS functions correctly, Wifi only supports 2.4 GHz and can not detect 5 GHz wifi, which is the major significant downside of this tablet. The download speed for Wi-Fi is about 5.8mbps while my iPhone gets 104mbps when connected to the same router but 5GHz Wi-Fi. Basically, you get what you paid for. The description stated configuration is not realistic in the $50 price range at this moment TBH.Set the specs aside, the performance of this tablet is ok, very ok. I mean you don't feel the responsiveness you get on your iPhone for sure, but you don't feel it is terribly slow either. It will become very slow if you install too many apps or run out of internal storage space, so you need to have a clear definition of what apps you want to keep on this tablet. I keep YouTube, Kindle, PrimeVideo, VLC, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, etc. because I define it as reading and video streaming devices. Light games such as Sudoku, Water Sort, and Plant vs. Zombie work just fine.This tablet came with the app iWawa, which is an educational app for kids. This app makes me wish I had bought this tablet earlier. If you have an Android tablet, check if you can install this app, highly recommended for babies and kids. Sadly it is not available for iPhone or iPad, but now I'm glad I bought this tablet. My original plan is to use this low-end Android tablet as a reading, shopping, and video streaming device while I do my game mission on my iPhone, now I have to do all this on my daughter's iPad Air3.In summary, screw the specs, if you have kids 2-8 years old, and you want a cheap but reasonable quality Android tablet to run iWawa, this one is more than good enough. It also works as a good enough low-end Android tablet as a reading, shopping, YouTube, and video streaming device, whenever your kids are not allowed to use the tablet.",1,NA

Definitely worth the price at the point.  With the S-Pen and the good usability of the tablet, I find it very useful for browsing and doing minor edits in Google Docs, etc.  The battery life is pretty decent, and the screen and sound is pretty good for watching videos.  Better than the Kindle 10 fire.So if you only want to watch videos / browse and not do much else, buying a Kindle 10 Fire on discount is probably a better deal.  Though if you want to do more productivity stuff, the S-Pen that comes with it is very handy.  There are plenty of affordable and sturdy cases for this device that will also hold the pen.In terms of speed, it works fine.  But if you've used an iPad Pro, you will notice it has more of a lag when loading new web pages.  Not enough to matter, but to be noted if you're used to the rapid loading speeds. Upon initial device setup, there's a lot of software updates, etc. which makes the lag more noticeable until they're all done.Finally, you can also consider the Samsung FE tablet, which is more premium table for more money.  I ended up sticking with this one, not because of the price, but because that one is about 20% heavier, and this lightweight tablet made it so easy to carry and use.  Also, there are sometimes trade programs to get the FE tablet.  If you use this one for a few years, then pay a little bit to get more for a new FE tablet, then it's an even better deal.  But you can't go wrong with the FE tablet now too if you're in the market for a more powerful device.",5,NA

It's been a while since I've looked into drawing tablets - back in the day if you wanted a good tablet for drawing you got a mid screen and all it did was draw.  No internet, nothing.  This is a full fat tablet (that basically does the role of a desktop or laptop for your average user) and it has a great pen experience.  I've been drawing with krita, which is a very feature dense program and there is no lag.The other thing it does great is media.  The screen is awesome and the speakers are surprisingly loud.  Because it's in the android ecosystem you can run Firefox as your browser and get ublock origin meaning you never have to see ads as long as you're using Firefox (notably for YouTube). The tablet also natively will keep playing YouTube when you turn off the screen.  Or at least it does with Firefox - never had any desire to download the app, frankly.  The screen is big enough to be a significant improvement over even a large phone. But not so big that it feels hard to be portable.The other half of media is games.  Obviously this is not a gaming PC.  It's not going to run any real heavy duty games.  But if you want it for mobile games especially card games like slay the spire, legends of runeterra, or hearthstone, then this is just basically the perfect device for them.  The screen has great color and contrast, so since graphical fidelity is not the limiter with these, they can actually look better on this than a PC because the screen is great.  It's also basically the perfect size for card games.  Large enough to feel like the full primo experience, but small enough you don't feel like you are dragging your finger across miles of realestate for every action.Seems the one place that isn't amazing is the battery.  The battery is fine.  It's not bad, it's not great.  It will last you long enough, but it's not going to knock your socks off.Unless you have a really specific reason that you absolutely NEED a larger screen or something, I can't really imagine recommending a different tablet at the moment.",5,NA

It is a great tablet at a reasonable price.The only negative is that the pen skips when drawing.  I decided to purchase a V-Pen to see if it was the pen or the tablet causing the problem, and the V-Pen works flawlessly with my drawing apps.  I was relieved to discover the problem was just the S pen. Product support (Samsung and Amazon) confirmed that I would have to send the tablet back in order to get a new pen (and tablet), which is the last thing I wanted to do after I had it all set up, so I decided to purchase some pen tips for the S pen to see if that fixes the problem.  The tip is wobbly, and I don't know enough about these pens to know whether or not that is normal. It's not really a problem because I like the V-Pen a lot,  but it would be nice to have a backup and know what was wrong with the S pen. (No, I'm affiliated with V Pen, it was a good choice for me!) I didn't see a need to give the tablet a less than 5 star rating because of the pen - the tablet is great, just be aware of the fact that the tablet has to go back too in the event the pen has issues and you need a new one. 5 stars!",5,NA
