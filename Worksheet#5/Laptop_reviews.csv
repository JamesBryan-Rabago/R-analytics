"1","Laptop","Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11‚Äù display","DoomOfSarnath","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","","Well, for $190-$230 this tablet might not be the best at one particular thing, but thanks to some common-sense decisions and Amazon's resources and commitment, it's competent enough at everything, all at once.Media consumption, retro games, word processing, digital art, battery life, you name it.For media consumers, it has an obscenely long battery life and a pretty nice screen. Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display (the black areas look black), colors are very poppy, and the 5:3 aspect ratio means you're not losing much space on either 16:9 or 4:3 content.For retro games, let's talk about the processor. It has a Mali G57 MC2, 2 Cortex A78 cores, and 6 Cortex A55 cores. Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup. The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest, cheap, power-sipping technology. While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point.But I'm certain Amazon did this on purpose, and it's responsible for the great battery life, which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet. The modest GPU and high number of ""little"" cores keep battery drain minimal (this is a 5w chip, in a tablet, where 7-10w chips are the norm) while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks.This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse, as that relies heavily on single-core performance, with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought.So, it's a tablet that just excels at anything where you'll be using the screen a lot. Reading, movies, old games, etc. It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU, but compared to retro games there aren't a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO.The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed.I'm typing this review on the keyboard case, and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor, with short travel and a nice tactile, springy feel. The trackpad is small, but accurate and doesn't ""lose"" my finger.The stylus itself uses a user-replaceable AAAA battery. I like this decision, because small Li-po batteries wear out fast, and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether you'll be able to find a replacement in a few years. The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet.The stylus is pretty accurate. I don't notice much parallax or judder. My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax. However, there is more input lag than you'll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil. It's a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two. I will mention, this tablet is about 1/3 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life. So it's still better than you expect for the price. But will definitely be more of an ""entry level"" art tablet instead of something outstanding.All in all, I still think you're getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available. Amazon's reach with e-readers, with keyboards, with stylus peripherals, with tablets, and their resources and supply chain (ie, being able to order unusual tablet SoCs) has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet. I can't really name anything I'd expect to be better for the price.The only real flaw is software; since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store, be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has.",5,NA

"3","Laptop","Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11‚Äù display","Missy","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024","","I've been using the fire max for over a year now. I have always been a kindle user. I must say this is the most superior so far. The speed is great the battery life is awesome. The new pressure sensitive stylus using the artrage app turns this fire into a superb drawing tablet. In my opinion you can't go wrong with the fire max 11. The size is perfect, the display is very vivid, and the speed is fast. The stylus uses a AAAA battery which at first I was disappointed with but it's been over a year and I'm still using the battery that came with it and I draw every day for for hours to a time. Now I see the battery as a plus, as I don't have to wait for it to charge. I assume someday I'll have to change the battery, but the tester says it's still has half left in it. So I'll be changing it next year üòÇ",5,NA
"4","Laptop","Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11‚Äù display","Missy","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024","""Versatile and Powerful Tablet!""","The good:The clearness of the screen while watching movies is nothing short of astonishing---brilliant, clear picture.  I bought the optional keyboard, and it's very functional and well made.  The size is wonderful; it's just big enough.The bad:The sound wildly fluctuates from movie to movie.  On The Lion in Winter, 1968, with Katharine Hepburn, I really had to turn it up.  On Miami Vice the series,I  hardly had to turn it up at all.The search button is very erratic.  It kept telling me I had to purchase something I knew I had already purchased.  The amazing Live Chat at Amazon customer service got it straightened out by telling me not to use the search button, but instead find something by going into My Purchases.  That works, but Amazon needs to either fix the Search button or eliminate it entirely.I've had to become a computer expert not by choice but by necessity, and here are some techie things:You can't change the Silk Browser to a different browser, and if you go to the Internet on the Silk Browser, expect many tiresome ads;You can't use a VPN (Virtual Private Network);You can't block ads if you've purchased the Fire Max 11 version that permits them.  For example, when playing a trailer for a movie, ads popped up.  Infuriated, since I paid for no ads, I immediately Live Chatted Amazon Customer Service and they removed them;Absolutely no printed manual came with this device.  To be fair, that's the rule nowadays, more's the pity.When all is said and done, I really, really like it.  One small gripe, though: I would never have bought this thing and all its' accessories if I was still able to watch Amazon Prime on my Windows 7 laptop.  When I tried, a dialog box came up telling me if I wanted to watch, I had to upgrade my computer to Windows 10 or higher.  I found that irritating, because I could still watch trailers for movies on my Windows 7 laptop!  So, I asked myself, if it can play trailers, why on earth can't it play movies?  But that's a small irritant.  Overall, I really like the Fire Max 11 and all the accessories I bought to go with it.",5,NA

"10","Laptop","Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 tablet","Luis A. Perez","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024","","I have been wanting to write this review for some time but now I'm finally getting to this.  Before this tablet I had the Fire HD 8 2020 and then the Asus Chromebook tablet CT100.  The Fire HD 8 was very sluggish, and I will never go back to smaller tablets because it was becoming unusable, and you could not even browse the web.  The Chromebook tablet was much better and was able to browse the web and use YouTube, but YouTube would hang up quite a bit.  So I finally upgraded to the Fire HD 10 2021 and I am very satisfied with this.  This would be the lowest budget version I would recommend to anyone, stick with the 10 inch version or higher.  I love using this, I can easily browse the web and work on my college classes as well.  I use many streaming services like Netflix, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Prime Videos and Paramount.  I use the offline feature alot for when I travel so I can watch movies on the go.  The battery life is also amazing and charge it about once or twice a week.  My main use is YouTube, so although YouTube is not officially supported I enjoy using it.  I do run into some issues if I am trying to multi task with YouTube and browse the web, or if there are background downloads of videos than YouTube will hang up.  But other than that it works great and I know this tablet was not optimized for YouTube and I think it has about 3GB of RAM.  So the Fire Max 11 would most likely work perfectly with barely any hangups.",5,NA

I got this one to replace mine and I love it.

Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive.  By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time.  I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress.  If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN.  Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only.  You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time.  Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password.  Your choice, as it should be.",4,NA

That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.",5,NA
"30","Laptop","Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH Slim Laptop","David Fisher","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024","This is NOT a Budget Laptop!","Pretty good laptop. Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.",5,NA

"41","Laptop","ASUS Chromebook CX1, 14 FHD","Redd Miea","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2022","","I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running.",5,NA

I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great.

Unfortunately, this one is for the latter.  I purchased this device to begin with as a laptop to be used by my son for Chicago public schools and allow him to be able to access his school work. Upon receiving the first unit physically, the device looks and feels wonderful and within 2 days of starting to use it. The screen was no longer capable for touch capabilities and the keyboard was non-functional as well.  I called their customer support line at Asus and Asus. Couldn't figure out what was wrong either, but I was supposed to pay to send a device I just bought to go have it repaired by Asus and this is why I say their customer service is knowledge below standard but I would say some of the worst there is on the market today.  Amazon luckily was able to step in and send me a new unit as a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is some of the best I've ever you dealt with.  Got the new unit and now this one over here. Can't even stay connected to Wi-Fi. My kid can't do his homework.  This computer is a total piece of garbage even for something as simple as a means to do homework for a grade school.

"58","Laptop","Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7","Pamela R. Merritt","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","","I needed an e-reader which could handle my needs, and that's why I rated my Fire 7 highly. I'm not using it to play games or stream movies or take pictures and videos. Though I got the no ads/32 gig model, because reading is serious business.Because it was my six year old Kindle Paperwhite that got me into this. I love reading on it, even library books. This is important, because I'm a writer (The Way of Cats book) and a devoted reader. To keep up with this favorite hobby, I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Still, there are many books, and I also subscribe to Scribd. I have books I own, and books I rent, essentially.Which makes my Paperwhite less of a general reader than I would like. I'm also researching a new book. I can send all these PDFs to my Kindle account, but it's not the same reading or highlighting experience as an optimized PDF reader. In my mind, I'd like to keep these documents, but not on my Bookshelf, mixed with the thrillers and the sciences.Recent thoughts of how long my Paperwhite would last led me to consider e-readers in general. Reading outdoors is combining two of my favorite things, where a dedicated e-ink device really shines, so some kind of Kindle reader is important to me. But I could really use a general purpose reader. This was my first attempt at combining these needs. I am very pleased.The Silk browser, included, let me navigate to the address of the Scribd app (information on the Scribd site.) This let me download a third party app, permission for which I first adjusted in settings. Currently testing PDF readers in the Amazon App Store, for some free books I got in that format.Now I have three readers in one. My Kindle and Scribd books update on my other apps, and I them as I've always done. This screen is as easy to read on as my iPad mini, so no complaints. My iPad is bigger and heavier, with the case and the Pencil, and not something I put in my purse if I don't need to. The Fire 7 works better for what I usually need a purse device for, which is reading and web browsing. My phone is really old and won't keep downloaded books for very long. The idea being that if I'm stuck somewhere with no wifi, I have books in the device. And they will be there.The Kindle app is almost fully operational, but I can't put books into Collections with it, and the layout is subtly different, but it works fine. If it gets confused, I restart it. It's not a high tech device, but it's great for the price.",5,NA
"59","Laptop","Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7","Pamela R. Merritt","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2023","Stars for use as an e-reader, which is why I got it","I snagged this latest 12 th gen 7‚Äù fire tablet at one of amazons sales $39 in late 2023. The latest chip and 2 gigs RAM makes a real difference compared to a 7‚Äù fire I had a couple or so years ago. Last one was basically useless, slow, crashed, and the book reader could not even smoothly do page curl turns. BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. IF YOU ARE A BOOK READER I ASSURE YOU THERE‚ÄôS A LOT TO LOVE HERE. (and see one more surprising positive below in my update). The kindle app is flawless and almost snappy on this device. Page turning page curls are smooth and totally free of stutter or lock up like the earlier generation. It has a LOT of nits of brightness - surprisingly VERY bright even for my somewhat older eyes. Making text a bit larger is great (if your vision can use that help) and the screen resolution is totally fine for reading text, no issues at all even though it seemed like it‚Äôs a bit lower resolution in its specs. I leave it full brightness and still the battery lasts forever. Given a choice of the e-ink kindle costing much more, and this tablet (I have both) this little 7‚Äù fire tablet is FAR SUPERIOR FOR BOOK READING THAN THE e-ink tablet: it is more responsive, agile in changing text size, and lots of nits of brightness for easy reading. If you buy it ONLY as a dedicated book reader, and especially if you get the $39 price - it‚Äôs a steal and an incredibly under recognized useful budget reading tablet. Scale of 1-10 as a book reader I give it a 10. No question.  More pros: surprisingly solid feel, no bending or creaking- really feels solid in the hand. Not too heavy but it‚Äôs not like so paper light that it feels flimsy. I recommend you get a case however cheap, because it is a little slippery to hold. Current OS on it is reasonably responsive and has not once ever crashed. Ok now some practical comparisons. As a tablet it is maybe a 4 on that same scale of 1 to 10: it is not super fast opening apps, the selection of fire available apps is poor, and you should accept that this is not a high end android or apple tablet. Yet, several streaming apps work flawlessly and you can watch media on it but the screen is a little washed out on color and lower resolution when your eyes compare to a high end tablet, or iPhone or 4k TV. The silk browser does work, just not super fast. The USB C charging port (!) was a splendid surprise, and the files app built into the OS let‚Äôs you surf a USB flash drive you can plus into that USB port which is surprising and kind of really cool FOR A THIRTY NINE DOLLAR TABLET! I did find that USB 3.0 maybe 3.1 works plugged into the USB C port but not USB 3.2. Last note: it has a standard headphone jack. Streaming audio including Spotify through headphones gives very very good sound. Shockingly the OS is sophisticated enough that you can plug a USB C to 3.5 mm female headphone adapter and plug headphones into that and it DOES stream the sound that way to headphones too. Sound quality seems identical either way. Portable, fun, great book reader, quite competent on card game apps and streaming apps including Netflix, Amazon prime, HULU, Disney, other free streamers like Crackle and Pluto and more; long lasting battery life, quite solid, lots of fun and so budget priced that if these capabilities sound appealing just buy the thing you will love it. Great toy to add to the small electronics fun gadgets in our lives.  Update 11 22 23:  one more positive to note: surprising but absolutely true: just discovered that Facebook's Messenger app will handle video calling and the result is extremely good - even shockingly good; sharp image, no dropped frames, perfect clean sound quality. Years ago it would have been impossible to imagine an inexpensive tablet gadget that could do video calls like that; yet, here we are. Outstanding!",5,NA
