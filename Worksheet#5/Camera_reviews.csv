The phone app recognized it immediately and it works perfectly.  This is a good upgrade from the Mini original that has also been working flawlessly for several years.  Better picture, small spotlight, and the black color is easier to hide from my dog Roscoe!  In fact, I call it my ""Roscoe cam"" as I use it to monitor him when I'm away.  The motion sensing function is excellent, and the camera comes up in the app quickly.  I had to turn off the notification option, as Roscoe was triggering the camera and sending a notification to my phone every few minutes when home alone.  Easy to do in the app.  Really good quality device, especially considering it doesn't break the bank!!",5,NA

We got a Black Friday deal that came with 2 cameras and a module. We have had them for almost a week now and have had no problems. No lost wifi  connection, motion detection alerts and pictures and live view are great. We are very happy with Blink and plan to purchase some additional devices.installation was very easy!",5,NA

I avidly used the Blink (first gen) indoor cameras to keep an eye out on my cats as well as any possible intruders.The first gen worked so well for me that I thought I should give the Blink 2 a try. They did not disappoint. Better picture quality AND it tells you the different type of motion in your home (whether it’s an animal or a person or a dust bunny caught on camera).I also have the Blink Doorbell and the App interface pairs perfectly with the entire camera system.If you want reliability that’s worth the price, this camera is the way to go.",5,NA

Sounds is good a bit low and some lag on the talking feature but decent. Can live view. Have multiple cameras in a group. Only cons are , they go ""offline"" randomly and nothing can do ton reset remotely. Have to come home, unplug n plug. Not very useful if away from home/ vacation. Also can not continuously live view. I believe it's 3 or 5 min intervals then have to go back in to the camera. For the price and what it can do, it's worth it. I have 6.",4,NA

So during Prime days...I jumped on the Blink bandwagon and boy and I glad I did.  I haven't had a single issue to date.  I've even ordered more cameras.  They're fantastic!  The resolution is great and the options you have in the setup is great.  You can turn the LED indicators off so it's not obvious the camera is on, you can turn the sound off, and a whole lot more.  They work great in the dark too!  I've got one indoor cam, a doorbell camera, the wired floodlight camera, and two outdoor cameras.  And the app is great too!",5,NA

The camera is compact and easy to set up—just plug it in, connect to the app, and you’re good to go. The HD video quality is excellent, and I love that I can see clearly even at night thanks to the night vision feature.What’s great is how customizable the settings are. I can adjust the motion detection zones to avoid unnecessary alerts, and the two-way audio lets me communicate with anyone at my door, which is a huge plus. Plus, the app is intuitive and lets me check the camera feed anytime, anywhere.The only downside is that it needs to be plugged in, so you have to place it near a power source, but that’s a small trade-off for the great performance. Overall, the Blink Mini 2 is a solid, affordable option for home security. Highly recommend!",5,NA

The kit gives you two lenses to use according to what you intend to shoot, at a price much less than if you were to buy those lenses separately. HOWEVER, once your pictures have been taken, the ability to transfer them to another device (smartphone or computer) is done wirelessly using wifi, and that is where the problem lies. I could never establish a consistent connection between the camera and my phone -- the software might work one time but not the next. Would have much preferred if there had been provided the appropriate cable for making such transfers. I've wasted so much time trying to get help from Youtube videos, without success, so I'm throwing in the towel and returning everything. Do yourself a favor and avoid the aggravation by choosing another option. /// UPDATE: Rather than return this camera I decided I would give the folks at Canon an opportunity to help (don't forget the Youtube videos necessarily, but maybe they weren't my best first choice). I was very pleasantly surprised by how well the support group at Canon helped me to understand how their camera-to-phone connection worked. First, there were NO long wait times to reach someone to talk to, both chat and phone personnel (LIVE, not bots, at least it seemed). They were friendly, patient, and caring. And knowledgeable! I am now able to easily transfer photos from my camera to my phone without any glitches. I did learn, however, that transferring videos is best done to a computer, as a computer will recognize Canon's video format while a phone may not. For that you'll need a mini USB cable (I advised Canon that it would be a sensible item to include with the camera kit, but it is conveniently available on Amazon). I can now confidently give this Canon camera kit a 4-star rating because I'm still getting familiar with its various modes of operation, otherwise I might have gone higher.",4,NA

I initially came across it during a digital photography class where it was provided, and subsequently, I purchased it myself! It's incredibly easy to operate and handle, and now I use it as my primary tool for commercial photography. The results are exceptionally clear in well-lit areas. There can be some difficulties when shooting at night without flash, but the photos still turn out great after post-processing! The following photo was taken using the M mode, and it offers a great user experience.The battery life is also impressive. When I'm just taking photos and not recording videos, I can shoot for three to four hours straight without the battery level dropping significantly. However, video recording consumes more battery. Additionally, this camera is highly versatile, producing excellent results in portrait and landscape photography, and is also ideal for street photography.",5,NA

It takes very high-quality pictures as well as videos and works great for my photography class and my needs for it. As someone who dabbles in photography but isn’t super heavily into it I would say this is a great starter camera as it also comes with directions on how to use it. One of the features that I really like is that an app connects the camera to your phone to directly download the pictures to your phone Via the camera Wi-Fi, (note the camera Wi-Fi is not actual Internet Wi-Fi and it’s only used to connect to your cellular device). It does also have a built-in flash into the camera to use at your disposal so you won’t need outside light sources as often. Dials also allow you to change the exposure to let in more light or let in less light, something that a device like your phone may not be able to do a bit more worth investing into.",5,NA

Of course, for such a low price, it should be great—it really is, along with sharp and of good quality, as only other cameras that are much more expensive deliver. The flip-out vlogging screen is, in fact, one of the most incredible features on this camera; that is what makes it really great for selfies, recordings, and on-the-go content creation.The camera is lightweight and very easy to use, which makes it perfect for a complete novice or anyone who wants hassle-free shots. However, the only downside is that the lens does not have an automatic cover, so dust can gather if you are not very careful. A quick wipe before use sorts the problem, but it is something to be aware of.All in all, this camera justifies an amazing value for its price tag, and I can definitely recommend it to anyone that needs something budget-friendly that’s worth using for photos or vlogging.",5,NA

This picture attached is a test shot I took to make sure that the camera was working.I think the best thing about this camera is that it is very straightforward and easy to use, with buttons and features that are self explanatory. I also like that the display can be flipped around for an easy selfie mode. Another feature I liked is that you can adjust the image quality on the camera itself, you can increase the pixels for a better picture or decrease it if you want. For the price, I really can’t complain. It doesn’t have the same advanced features as more premium cameras, but it’s great for anyone just getting into photography or looking for a backup camera.Overall, I’m very impressed with its performance, especially for the price. It offers a lot of features typically found in more expensive cameras, making it an excellent value for beginners or casual photographers.

The camera quality is about the same as my phone but with much better lighting, so it's not suuuper HQ but if you've been using a supbar phone to take pictures like I have for the past few years, this is definitely an upgrade. So my advice is, if quality is super important to you than I would look for another camera since this one is average. However, it is aesthetically pleasing and definitely gives off home video vibes. Only downsides are, 1. that the focusing is a little tricky to get a hang of, and if you get close to the camera it goes out of focus. 2., for selfie mode, you can't rotate the screen that's flipped it just stays in place, and 3., the camera falls forward when trying to balance it on a surface. You definitely need a tripod or something of the sort to keep the camera propped up. For the price it seems like a well made camera so far that won't break, and a very good replacement for my phone's limited storage.I will say, with this camera I literally took the best selfie ever!
