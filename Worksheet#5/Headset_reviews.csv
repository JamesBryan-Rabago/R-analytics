"15","Headset","OneOdio PRO1030 DJ Headphone","Chad","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024","","I recently picked up the OneOdio Over Ear Headphones, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

"16","Headset","OneOdio PRO1030 DJ Headphone","Patrick","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019","Excellent Sound Quality for Both Podcasting and Electric Drum Sets","I have a HP laptop with speakers that are less than desirable.  Compound this with a lifetime of audio problems, (hard of hearing), and the speakers are pretty much useless.  A set of cheap computer/desktop speakers were purchased with good results as they had a separate volume control plus a jack for headphones/earbuds.  Having a small desk, It was getting crowded between the laptop, the speakers and the desk light, compounded by the fact that the whole set up is against a wall that goes out to a common hallway.  This restricts my volume as I don't need to have anyone hearing what I'm doing while I am online.  Thus the purchase of these headphones.I chose headphones over earbuds as my ears easily get irritated when something is inserted.  My main concern was two fold. The first is I have a large head, (size 7 5/8) and past ear protection devices have been pretty much uncomfortable both against the ears and overall.  The second is perspiration as sweat build up occurs after extended wear.  Being quite a while since I wore headphones, (2012) I did note an improvement but was still a bit gun shy.To be honest, these were not my first choice.  I initially saw a set of DJ headphones with a 9' cord which appealed to me for freedom of movement.  For whatever reason, these were ordered instead.These headphones came 4 days after ordering through standard, free shipping.  Arriving in a soft pack with a bubble lining, the headphones were in a box enclosed within a sleeve.  This made unwrapping a bit of a challenge as I wanted to save the box in case of return.  Finally gaining entry, the headphones were in a bubble wrapped bag and two sets of wiring were enclosed within another.  It was then I realized my error.  Throwing caution to the wind, I took them out and read the enclosed the multi language manual.  This was helpful as it was discovered that the ear pieces work somewhat like a person's neck.  One side rotating 90 degrees counter clockwise and the other 90 degrees clockwise.  Both tilted both up and down and both have extenders to adjust to the wearer.  Also noted was the padding.  Both ear pieces had generous padding as well as the top of the head set.  It was nice to note that both sides of the ear pieces had outlets to accomodate the speaker wires.  This makes it easier to plug the side in from the source thus avoiding crossover.Two sets of wires came.  The first was a red, stretchable cord with a 6.5mm plug for items like guitars and speakers on one end and a 3mm plug for the head set.  The cord is 2m long but can be stretched to 3m.  The second cord is a 1.2m standard cord with 3mm plugs on both ends.  There is also a ""control"" button should the wearer have the headphones plugged into a phone.Assembling the pieces, I plugged the 3mm into the cheap speakers and ran a gauntlet of various apps from music to gaming.  WOW! WOW! WOW! A full, rich, clear sound was experienced through both earpieces despite the plug being on the right side.  Every sound was heard, no matter how subtle.  I did note, however, it was a bit ""bassy"" for my preference, but I was completely overwhelmed by the sound quality.  Wondering if maybe the speakers may have some influence, I plugged the headset directly into the laptop.  NOPE!  No change in quality and I gained a little more cord in the process.After playing for about two to three hours, It was pleasantly noted that the only time it was noted the headset was on was when I reached up to my head to scratch.  Very lightweight, snug, yet comfortable even with glasses.  No sweat experienced.  No discomfort against the ears or atop the head.  The cheap speakers were then moved and attached to another device that also had less than desirable speakers.  It is unknown about the noise cancellation as the residence is pretty quiet with the exception of others going up and downstairs as well as the upstairs resident.  Time will tell.These are definately a keeper.  Even though I have owned these less than a day, I am totally impressed with the looks, feel, and performance of these headphones.  Definately a keeper and highly recommended!!!!04/29/2019 update.  These have almost constantly on my head and I have made a couple observations.  1.  Despite being ""full"" ear headphones, they are not sound blocking.  On a couple of occasions, I have been hearing knocking on my door as well as the phone ringing and someone talking, even though I couldn't understand what was spoken.  Both have originated about 20 feet away.  2.  the head band has a tendency to slide forward towards the forehead.  I haven't figured out why yet and will post when I do.  Right now I am testing a couple of theories.",5,NA

"22","Headset","JBL Quantum 400 Headphones Game Chat","Konrad K.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024","","This is my first set of dedicated Gaming headphones in almost 10 years. My first set was a pair of Turtle Beaches that had been a loyal companion. I'm a ""use it until it breaks"" type of person, I don't game very much, however, my turtle beaches started to fade and crackle, and they also went through a fair amount of abuse.Comfort.I never realized how big of an impact a set of headphones may have on the overall experience. I almost went with another set of TBs because that's what I've used but the Quantum 400s were on on sale so I bit the bullet and I am AMAZED. I had about 2 hours before the Turtle Beaches would start to squeeze my head, one free night I had with some friends, I went for 6 hours (with small breaks in between) with no ear/head fatigue. The cups fit right over my ears snugly, and the strap breaths well without putting much pressure down on my head. They're earhugs.Sound.The TBs were as basic as basic gets, the audio was good but very linear, and the upside to them was no third-party app to wake them up. The JBLs sounded tinny and cheap before I downloaded the software, however, plug them in via USB, and VOILA  the software was downloaded and tinkered with, HOLY JESUS. It's an experience for me. The spatial audio immersed me in the game, tuning me into the environment.Mic.The mic is another really big plus for me. And I find JBL makes it hard to compete with them in this regard, the audio is crisp clear, and well-tuned, My mates have no issue hearing any comments or commands in the lobbies.My favorite feature is the lift to mute. That is without a doubt an absolute gem. As a student, I spend a lot of my time in front of the screen, so if I'm not looting for treasures, or getting blown to bits, I'm typically listening to music while I write or watching lectures. Moving the mic out of the way creates a more open atmosphere.Build Quality.The build quality is where I can't provide any insight, they're plastic, and as such encourage me to be extra careful. Some of the joints seem a tad flimsy and loose, however, it seems like the design intends it to pivot easily for less pressure on your head, which is a trait of their comfort.Overall.These are spectacular headphones for what you're spending, they easily check all of the boxes in terms of quality and sound processing.The only thing to note for me is that I will be investing in a wireless set in the future, some days I like to stand while I study or just simply stretch my legs.Nevertheless, in a pinch, you cannot go wrong with the Quantum's.",5,NA

"25","Headset","JBL Quantum 400 Headphones Game Chat","Alex B.","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2022","the best headphones I have ever owned","Different people want different features, but for me these are just about right.+ You don't have to remember to charge these, and they'll never run out of charge in the middle of something, because they're wired. The cable doesn't bother me, but batteries dying does.+ That means these are probably going to have longer lifespans than wireless ones also, because there aren't batteries to stop holding a charge.+ While I wouldn't use these for serious audio work (i.e. recording or mixing) they are at a good quality/price point for playing games, casual music listening for enjoyment, YouTube, and so forth. The sound is clear, clean, and fairly detailed. They're basically competitive with other headphones in the $80 - $120 range, which these days means they're pretty good.+ They work fine with the M1 Mac, including the ""Game/Chat Balance"" dial.+ The way that the balance dial works, on Mac at least, is that when you plug the USB cable into your computer, two sound output destinations show up in the audio settings: JBL Quantum 400 Chat"" and ""JBL Quantum 400 Game"". First, set your system sound to the ""JBL Quantum 400 Game"" output (Or do it in your game's audio settings if it doesn't use the system audio.) Then, go into Discord's audio settings (or Zoom, or whatever program you're using for chat) and instead of using the system audio output, choose the ""JBL Quantum 400 Chat"". And then, it just works and you can adjust the balance dial to your heart's content.+ The size is adjustable in the usual ways, and they are comfortable enough on my head, even after quite a few hours. This will, of course, vary from person to person.+ I like the placement of the Mute indicator LED on the end of the microphone where you can just see whether it's muted with your peripheral vision, without it being intrusive.- As far as I can tell there isn't a Mac version of the JBL software to do EQ, control the LED colors, etc. This doesn't matter to me, but maybe it does to some people out there.",5,NA

The spatial sound quality is distinctive, I feel like the sound comes from surrounding (of course I have the headset on). I can't tell whether it has noise canceling but ambient noise doesn't seem to interfere with the sound from the headphone...maybe it's loud enough. I don't use the audio cable with 3.5mm plugs as it doesn't allow all functionalities of the headset. Buttons and dials  work only if the USB cable is connected.In terms of comfort, I wear glasses and the headset doesn't my ears at all, the soft ear pieces cover my ears well. The material does allow skin to breathe so I don't sweat after long hour having them on.The mic records high quality sound.A little disappointment, I can live with it, is the mic mute/unmute button doesn't work with Microsoft Teams...meaning that this button doesn't change the mute/unmute in button in MS Teams during meeting.

"35","Headset","Razer BlackShark V2 Gaming Headset","Pers","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024","","I've been using these for a little over a week now. They're really light which adds to the comfortability. Usually headphones give me pain from clamping down on my jaw but these don't. Overall, really comfortable. I'm no audiophile but I think the sound quality is great (not using the 7.1 spatial surround sound software). The mic quality is decent. It's not the most clear and crisp mic but for gaming it definitely works well. One of my concerns for how this will hold up are the cable, as it is just encased in a plain silicone/rubber like material and the part where the cable connects to the headset is a little loose. Another concern I have is the fake leather on the padding. There's a good amount of it on the headset and I'm concerned that it'll inevitably flake off. Will try to provide updates on any issues I run into with them. For now, they're great.",5,NA
"36","Headset","Razer BlackShark V2 Gaming Headset","Jude","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024","So far so good.","The Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset is what I was presented with when I googled ""Durable Gaming Headset"" while shopping for a headset for my 11-year-old son who goes through xbox controllers and gaming headsets like #00 buckshot through a goose. Sure there are less expensive headsets, but this one is well built and for its price it is shockingly feature-rich.I can't yet speak to the durability; but, out-of-the box, this headset is so nice that I had to have one myself. The sound quality is even better than my $200 Sennheiser headphones and the mic is exceptionally clear (I play in parties with my son) and the flexible mic boom is much more durable than the rigid plastic ones. These headsets are comfortable and the volume knob and mute button are handy and effective. The noise-cancelling is, again, better than that of my Sennheisers.My only gripe is a minor one and that is that these headphones don't fold up for storage, which is not a big deal for a dedicated gaming headset, but might be good to know before you purchase them.",5,NA
"37","Headset","Razer BlackShark V2 Gaming Headset","Brewergamer","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024","","As a PC gamer, I know how important it is to have the right gear for an immersive gaming experience that doesn't cost a fortune. I recently tested the Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset, and I can't wait to share my insights. Priced at just $50 (on sale frequently), this headset offers remarkable quality for its cost, making it a fantastic choice for budget-conscious gamers. Although the microphone quality could be improved, it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, especially if you would consider investing in a standalone microphone.In this review, I will detail the headset's features, discuss its advantages and disadvantages, and provide my overall impressions. Let‚Äôs jump in!Design and ComfortWhen it comes to comfort during those marathon gaming sessions, this headset truly excels. It features soft, breathable memory foam ear cushions that conform to your ears, and the well-padded headband ensures a snug yet comfortable fit. I wore this headset for over four hours during a gaming session, and I didn't experience any discomfort.My previous headset (The Razer Kraken) lasted me well over 3 years before I needed a replacement, and that was a headset I used daily. It goes to show the durability of Razer's products for the most part.Sound QualityNow let‚Äôs talk about sound quality. The BlackShark V2 X uses 50mm drivers that provide clear audio across a broad frequency range. Whether I was engaged in a pulse-pounding battle or exploring the serene landscapes of an RPG, the audio was immersive. The punchy bass really stood out; it enhanced the depth of explosions and pivotal moments in gameplay.During my sessions, the directionality of sound was impressive. In competitive gaming, being aware of where opponents are is very helpful. The BlackShark V2 X allowed me to easily identify enemy locations and hear important in-game cues, leading to improved performance in several matches.Microphone QualityWhile the sound quality of the headset impresses, the microphone quality could definitely be better. The cardioid microphone is adequate for in-game communication but lacks the clarity many gamers desire. It definitely will get the job done though I wouldn't expect any high quality audio from it.For those serious about gaming communication, I recommend investing in a standalone microphone. External microphones can significantly enhance the clarity of your voice, especially for streaming or content creation. While the mic on the BlackShark V2 X is a bit underwhelming, it won't be a dealbreaker and will function as needed.  I would say that any standalone microphone even a lower end one (Such as the FIFINE Gaming USB Microphone https://amzn.to/4hU3xMH ) will be many times better than most headset microphones.ConnectivityThe headset connects via a 3.5mm jack, making it straightforward to use with various devices like PCs, consoles, and mobile devices. Razer typically includes a splitter cable for separate audio and mic input, which adds versatility for different setups. If your product does not include a splitter, these can be had for well under $5. Of course this will not be necessary if you are investing in an external microphone.You won't have to deal with complex setups or additional software‚Äîjust plug it in and go. This ease of use is appealing for gamers who want to jump right into action without any hassle. The Razer software is not required, and in my experience their software has not been the greatest anyways.Great Value for MoneyThe most appealing aspect of the Razer BlackShark V2 X is its price. At $50, it provides an excellent blend of quality, comfort, and performance.  While there are a wide range of headsets at lower price points, it's hard to beat the quality and durability of Razer for the price.For budget gamers, this headset is a fantastic deal. It performs well across various categories, providing an excellent investment for anyone looking to elevate their gaming without overspending.Final ThoughtsIn summary, the Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset stands out in the entry-level gaming headset market. Its attractive design, comfort, and decent sound quality make it an excellent choice for gamers who value quality and affordability. While the microphone may need improvement, it‚Äôs not a significant flaw, especially with the option for standalone mics.If you are a PC gamer on a budget, consider giving the BlackShark V2 X a try. At $50, it offers a great gaming experience without draining your wallet. Remember, a good gaming headset can significantly enhance how you enjoy your favorite games.  Happy gaming!",4,NA

"49","Headset","Turtle Gaming Headset PlayStation Nintendo Console","Blake","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2015","Great Sound and Comfort at a Budget-Friendly Price","For this price point, I can't say anything less than 5 stars for this headset. I was originally going to go with a different product until seeing that the Ear Force Recon 50(X) series, was to release on 9/25/15. I decided to give it a try, and figured why not. For $40 it seemed like a steal!For the most part, it is a steal.PROS:--The headset itself is good looking, at first I thought the green would be a little off-putting compared to the color of my other accessories and peripherals, but it actually looks really great. Of course, this part is subjective.--Very lightweight. This thing only weighs a few ounces, and other than the light sensation of the cups on your ears, you could not even know you have it on.--The mic is detachable, which is awesome.--Further, the mic sounds great. It picks up my voice with a pretty good clarity for an entry-level gaming headset, and the attached covering of the mic essentially works as a pop filter. In fact, I have a fan blowing right by me and it manages to cancel the vast majority of the wind rushing into it from the fan. Solid mic.--The sound is pretty good. Bass and highs are on par for this price point, with the mids being the weakest link of the sound stage. For music and movies it is probably not the best choice, although it would still work more than adequately for those uses. Gaming is where it really shines, and the sound quality is more than good enough for my gaming needs. Footsteps are defined, gunshots and explosions sound great, and voices and dialog sound just fine.--Adaptability and Connectivity: It connects to the Xbox One controller that has the 3.5mm plug-in, and works on any Xbox One controller with the Turtle Beach or Microsoft headset adapter. My controller has the plug directly on it, so it works flawlessly without the need of an adapter. Further, it includes an adapter to change the mic/headphones to two separate plugs and I tested it on my PC and it works great for both sound and mic as well. Even though it is marketed as an Xbox One headset, it works just fine on PC and my iPhone. I don't have a PS4 to try it on, but I would imagine it would work just fine.CONS:--Like mentioned above, the sound is pretty much on par. Nothing special and certainly doesn't blow your mind with audio fidelity. However for this price range I can't imagine it gets much better. Mids could be a bit better with frequency range.--The cord is rather short. Granted, this model is targeted specifically towards the Xbox One, so plugging it into the controller with the cord length is more than enough, and nice because you don't have a huge bundle of cord on your lap when it is plugged into your controller. However, for use with a PC or other device you might need to purchase a 4 pole 3.5mm extension cable to make it a bit longer. I managed to find several on Amazon for a few bucks, so if this is a problem for you I would recommend going the extension cable route instead of disregarding this headset.OVERALL:I rated 5, but would probably give closer to a 4.5. For $40 (current price at time of writing, the day this headset has been released), it is a great deal. I am very happy with it, and use it as my main headset for my Xbox now, and a backup for my PC. Very comfortable, lightweight, sound is more than adequate in terms of quality, and it works with a multitude of devices. For gaming, it is just an all-around great entry-level headset.",5,NA
"50","Headset","Turtle Gaming Headset PlayStation Nintendo Console","Xeromaus & Family","Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2016","","I'm a HUGE fan of ""low-end"" turtle beach headsets, and I bought these to replace an aging pair of Ear Force PLa's that had served me faithfully for a long time (and still function very well, albeit thanks to a ton of tape work on damage I caused myself stupidly). Considering I paid only ten dollars more for these, the difference is staggering.As others note, they're not a top end headset, but for $40, do you really expect that? Sound is clear and crisp. Mic is clear and loud, without being overly sensitive (and the windscreen performs very well), and connects/disconnects easily... I'm actually using Dragon to type this with the mic in my laptops mic port! Some complain that the mic is inflexible, but I haven't found a position yet that it won't accept and stay with. I do, however, wish they had used the jacketing from the PLa line (ribbed, semi-metallic covering that allowed for total freedom of position) instead of the semi-hard, plastic-feeling overmold on this one.Leather-feel ear cups are VERY well designed and generously padded, they feel very natural on my head and surround my ear with an almost hermetic seal... pressing on the sides of the cups while wearing them yields a noticeable increase in pressure in my ears (you probably shouldn't do this).Entire system is very light (due in part to plastic construction, which doesn't come off feeling as ""cheap"" as other plastic headsets).At 4ft, the cord doesn't give a ton of room, but it was designed to be used with a console controller audio jack, so it doesn't need it... but for use with an mp3 player or laptop, it's great for those that don't need the extra length getting in the way.Some cons:In-line volume/mic control is small and hard to grasp (almost too smooth), and in turn, the volume control knob is very narrow and set deeply in the control box. When you do locate the volume blindly, it's somewhat difficult to roll, but I'm going to assume it will loosen in time. I would suggest moving it closer to the wire's splitter to make it easier to locate blindly, but it's a personal preference some may disagree with.The mic only inserts into the headset in one direction, having a cut out on the mic itself that must be aligned with a tab on the mic jack. It's difficult, though not impossible, to insert it while wearing the headset, so I suggest you choose in or out before you begin using them. I see no reason why this design had to be implemented, and hope future models will omit it.The connecting band has very little in the way of padding across the top of your head. It's not only a very small fill, but it's the same low density, very soft foam used in the ear cups, making it almost ineffective. It's not uncomfortable once you get the fit right for your head (though mine is shaved, your mileage may vary), but it still seems no thought at all went into this design point. Increasing the fill or using a higher density foam could fix this in future models.Each ear cup is connected to one half of the wire, which I personally don't enjoy the feel of, though its double connection design does prevent a lot of twisting that could lead to a single wire design pulling out of it's grommet. The wire(s) itself is very soft and flexible, which while offering comfort, I'm afraid would be easily abraded or pinched.All in all, you would be hard pressed to find another headset that offers more or performs better at or near this price point...it may even be an impossibility. Though PLa's are cheaper and more than adequate, for any looking for an entrance point into the headset market, these are without a doubt the only headset I will ever recommend again. If you need higher performance, just move up the price scale in the turtle beach line, each offering will blow you away.",5,NA

"57","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","Liza S","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024","","I had a specific need: What's a headset I can recommend to my overseas coworkers (some who mumble with thick accents) that has a VERY clear mic, good headphone sound quality, works as USB-A or old-school headphone miniplug, and all-day comfort... and under $60.We have a winner! I would say this has an EXCELLENT mic (the best I've tested), very good comfort, and very good headphones. I also have Sony studio headphones (no mic), and I am an audiophile who could bore you with the details of why those are better for recording, music, etc. But these Corsairs will give anyone audio listening enjoyment. I'm relatively picky about this, but I do know that for 90% of listeners, these sound good enough to be their only music headphones and they wouldn't tell any difference with my Sony's.Alternatives I looked at:The Logitech H390a is a cheapy, with a very clear, VERY bright (perhaps overly bright for many speakers, but this is a fabulous solution for mumblers) microphone, but stiff headphone pads on the ears. I did a 1-hour call with them, and it was okay... but I wouldn't want them for 3 hours in a row.The SteelSeries Artic Nova 1P - I wanted to love these, comfy, great headphones, but the mic is a little muffled, especially when too close to the mouth. But yeah, nowhere near the mic quality of this one.I dropped a whopping $160 on the Jabra Evolve2 65 - and everyone should know this: 95% of the WIRELESS headsets out there are going to have very poor audio from the bluetooth for the mic. I returned these when I found out. Wanted to love them for their comfort and headphone quality, but the lack of high-frequencies in the mic is a total deal breaker for me.If you want the most UNDERSTANDABLE audio quality for work calls, this Corsair set is the best I've found!  Better than the apple wired set. (which was my previous gold standard, but certainly picks up way more environmental noise.)",5,NA
"58","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","Bri","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","Excellent sounds (mic and headphones) and very good comfort","I love these! They're good quality, comfy, and they don't have that crazy LED-lights-blazing aesthetic that all ""gaming"" things seem to have.  I tested the audio while playing Minecraft since I already had it open: at first, I heard a bit of static when I turned the volume on high and was disappointed. But  then I used the usb adapter it came with instead of the aux (headphone jack) slot and it sounds very high quality with no static at all.Update: the mic works perfectly! Pretty average quality according to my friends when I asked, but nothing to complain about for regular gaming.Comfort-wise, these don't bother my head or ears at all. They're actually comfortable and completely cover my ears without pressing down on them or moving around a bunch. I don't have as big a head as my boyfriend though- he said he personally found them to be very uncomfortable (he's also used to his nice Cooler Master headphones)  Another thing I took note of was the texture of the ear muffs: very very soft on the part that touches your head, while the sides have a nice-feeling leather material.  When you extend the headphones for a wider fit, the inside part is made of metal which I like and they don't feel loose or woobly at all. These feel like they will last me a long time and I'm super happy with my purchase.Update: use these almost daily and they still look brand new!",5,NA
"59","Headset","CORSAIR SURROUND Multiplatform Gaming Headset","Bri","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2020","","While working from home, my Logitech on-ear headset was beginning to cause rashes on my ears from hours of continuous use.  To be fair, the maybe 2 hours of day they were used pre-pandemic when I was working in the office was fine.  However, the 8 to sometimes 12 hours a day was not working.  I wanted to find an over the ear headset but didn't want to invest too much into some of the game headsets.  I already have two Sennheiser gaming headsets which fill their role but are on the expensive side.The Corsair HS60 is a good set of headphones, especially if you can pick them up on an Amazon sale.  I have a relatively small head and the headset fits snug.  The top is padded but it can start to bug you if you are wearing the headset for many hours straight (and you have little to no hair for cushion).  You can adjust it so it's not resting on your head but then the headset will lean forwards or backwards which you will feel around your ears.  I've had extended days of working and have worn the headset for almost 10-11 hours in a day.  Not continuously, but total and have had very little discomfort.The sound quality is really good for the price (on sale).  No, it's not going to beat an expensive Sennheiser set, but it does not disappoint with sound quality.  I'm an avid music fan and have not been unhappy with the quality.  Keep in mind, this might vary depending on what you are using to drive the headphones.  If you have an elaborate Schiit system or something higher end, look at higher end headphones.  For normal computer and/or soundcard output, the headphones do really well and have a good range.The mic is another topic.  As you can see from the pictures, the mic is not a boom mic.  It is optional to use and plugs into the headset with a 3.5mm connector.  The headset does not echo your mic through the headset.  Also, these are a close back headset.  This means you can't really hear yourself taking and sometimes has you yelling into the mic to hear yourself through the close back headset.  The other thing is that the mic reads extremely quiet in Windows.  I did some searching through online forums and found this to be common.  Even with the mic cranked to the maximum in Windows, it still reads low when you talk.  The good thing is that I haven't had any complaints of co-workers not hearing me but it does make you feel like you need to speak louder.Since the mic isn't a boom mic, you can't just swing it out of the way.  You can bend it out of the way of your mouth (if you are eating or drinking) but you can't really get it out of your viewing area which may bug you.  Next, when you lay down the headset, since the mic isn't a boom mic it's a little awkward.  If you lay it forward, you have to bend the mic back.  If you lay it backwards, you will move the dial on the back for volume.  If you have a headset stand, then it doesn't matter.The volume dial, this is likely the weakest part of the headset.  The volume dial is extremely easy to accidently move.  The last complaint is the USB cord.  I believe it's got a nylon coating which means it's forever tangled.  I've had similar cords before on other devices and trying to untangle and keep them untangled typically does more damage than good to the cord.  I wonder if some of the reviews complaining about the cord breaking were trying to keep it untangled.Overall, for the money (on sale), it's a good product.  Don't expect $200+ headset quality for $50 (or whatever the current sale price).  I do think at $100, there are some other options out there but at $60 or less, these are good to have in your consideration.",5,NA

Lipsitz","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023","Wouldn't change a thing, great value for the money","Sound quality is very good for this price-point.  Noise cancellation is effective and good for this price.  Comfort leaves some things to be desired (especially my  ears).  The firm fit otherwise is good, but not enough if you have long fine hair to prevent positioning sliding around.  The mic can hear me without picking up traffic noise from several miles away (I can't be heard in person from more than several feet away).I've never quite understood lights on wired headsets, the one very bright one on the tip of the mic boom effects camera exposure settings.  It comes with an adapter for its unified 3.5 mm jack to split the mic and audio into two jacks for older laptops and desktops that require these.  The cable is long enough to keep away from noisy laptop fans, and includes, and has a USB connector to power the lights if one wishes to.  There is also an inline mute switch and volume control so one can adjust to switching between virtual and real world needs without having to open an app or find infrequently used keyboard Fn controls.While I don't see myself wearing this continuously during long flight simulation settings due to the comfort issues, it is suitable for my  many other needs (especially not disturbing neighbors at night with my music or gaming sounds).  I am still satisfied with this purchase, especially the mic's ability to hear me (finally!), and feel  this item is well worth the purchase price.",4,NA

"82","Headset","BENGOO G9000 Controller Cancelling Headphones","JUAN","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024","","I use these for call of duty and youtube some times my oculus 2. The rgb works with a smooth fade out loop although it's not addressable rgb it's pretty nice they even send adapters so it you want to power the rgb when your on xbox or ps5 it's independent from the controller power source (batteries) for pc you can just hook it up.Con the volume and mute switch on mine usually faces inward not a huge problem but sometimes moving around with raise or lower the volume a minor inconvenience if I would have designed it one would be on each side instead.Pros decent sound quality yesterday it saved me from being shot from behind in cod mw 2.0 the surround sound is decently crisp. The company is eager to please to to make sure you like it by the time I got it and started using it after a week they were checking up on how I liked it. After a couple messages back and forth he/she told me about the rgb being independent from the jack. Most of the rgb wired headphones I've seen aren't separated and only work on the pc. Now even watching TV (I have a projector) I can use the rgb. Microphone works as it should noise canceling I never hear complains from other players. The top fabric for comfort is comfortable I'm keeping the plastic they package it with to keep it clean. Each ear side get an addition inch approximately of length for people with bigger heads. The plastic ear cuffs are not going to flex unless to beat it with a heavy object the head band has just enough flex to it. And the microphone can be moved as it's flexible but also turned all the way pointing up . The head jack and usb splitter is pretty long about 6ft or so and it comes with a quality velcro cord piece to roll up for non use meaning if you wanted to you could put it on a headphone stand and hide the cords from you cat so it's not dangling.Suggestions to the company slightly thicker ear cups would be nice I got big ears so they kinda touch the inner fabric of the cuff and if I squeeze a little bit there's a little but of suction in my ears. Change the volume scrolling wheel to a sliding one and put it opposite of the microphone mute switch.Possible issues sometimes the microphone doesn't register on cod mw 2.0. However this is more likely to be call of duty chat program than the headphones because it happened multiple times with other headphones as well.",4,NA

"93","Headset","Stealth Wireless Multiplatform Amplified Headset","Terry Riner","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2024","","The Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 is a work of art. They sound like a pair of Astro A30s on steroids with enhanced low-end capabilities. Right out of the box, they offer an impressive range, surpassing even most supposedly certified high-resolution headphones.These headphones are comfortable, sleek, stylish, and very well made. They don‚Äôt look like typical gaming headsets; instead, they resemble a pair of Sony or Bose headphones that you can wear in public without fear of looking out of place. Just compare their visual appeal with Sony‚Äôs Inzone series or the latest from Bose if you don‚Äôt believe me.The cushions are superior to the breathable ones found on SteelSeries and even Razer‚Äôs latest Kaira Pros. While the packaging might be a step down from their usual, you‚Äôre getting way more headset for your buck this time around.I tested the headset‚Äôs Bluetooth range up to 30 feet with no drops or connection issues, even with walls, doors, and furniture in the way. The wireless dongle had a similar range, maintaining a stable connection throughout. I didn‚Äôt test if any advanced Bluetooth formats worked with them, but that‚Äôs not what they were purchased for. They were bought to replace a broken set of SteelSeries Nova 7s for my niece. I was shocked by how good they sound because you are getting $230+ level sound for around a hundred bucks.The battery life of the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 is nothing short of impressive. I ran them continuously for 25 hours to test for any degradation, and they are still going strong as I write this review. This is particularly notable given the manufacturer's claimed battery life of 80 hours. When we first got them, they were nearly dead, but they fully charged in just a couple of hours. While your experience may vary, my testing suggests that these headsets are built to last through extended gaming sessions without needing frequent recharges.The top leatherette cushion is far superior to what the Astro A30s or new 50s have. It‚Äôs actually on par with or better than the Kaira Pro in terms of overall comfort (and no one can deny Razer Kairas are comfortable), but not quite as comfortable as SteelSeries. However, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that these are very adjustable and have little clicks when extending either rail, making it easy to ensure both sides are the same length. The headband‚Äôs cushion is plush and well-padded, providing excellent support during long gaming sessions. Finally, the Stealth 600 Gen 3 offers a snug (but not too snug) fit and, unlike nearly all my other headsets (Audeze Maxwell, Astro A30, SteelSeries Nova Pro wired, which are the three I use regularly), they don‚Äôt fall off my head when looking down.The only con I can think of is that they don‚Äôt allow simultaneous communication or mixing between sources. You have to choose either wireless (dongle) or Bluetooth. I don‚Äôt really knock it for that because that feature alone usually drives up the cost, and you likely won‚Äôt find it on a headset that costs under $130-150. You can keep two sources connected simultaneously though for quick switching, just not mixing so the advertised features might be a bit misleading. On the flip side, unlike most wireless gaming headsets, you don‚Äôt have to purchase an additional accessory for them to work with your PS5, PC, or Switch. This headset works with virtually all devices.The EQ customization can be done via PC or Mobile App. While only five or so bands are available to customize, it‚Äôs enough for enthusiasts to get the most out of the headset. Many headsets, like those from SteelSeries, don‚Äôt even have a mobile app, so Turtle Beach is competing well with the Astro A30/50. The microphone is superior to what‚Äôs offered with any sub-$200 headset, and the AI noise canceling makes them on par with the A50s, though still not quite at Nova Pro level.Note: The low latency is the only reason I would ever suggest or consider the updated Astro A50s. I want to point this out because a lot of folks are sold on that headset and it really just isn‚Äôt all that impressive. It allows for lower latency because it uses HDMI pass-through (which also requires an additional ultra high speed HDMI included if you want to use it for more than one device), but it creates quite the cable mess and costs 3.5 times more than this headset! While the A50s sound great (superior to the A30 and Stealth 600 Gen3), they do not compare to the Audeze Maxwell. Therefore, I cannot recommend them. In fact, the new Turtle Beach Gen 3 headsets (500, 600, and Pro) make it difficult to recommend anything else if you‚Äôre looking for the best value for your money. I‚Äôm very curious to see what the new 700 Gen3s will be like because all they can really add at this point is source mixing, which might be worth the extra cost.**Takeaway:** For $100, this is quite literally one of the best gaming headsets you can buy. The only headsets that might be a little better are the Astro A30s or Nova 7s, both of which either break $200 or are very close to it. Plus, the Novas are notorious for having swivels that don‚Äôt appear to be lasting, and the A30s‚Äô only advantages are the mixing (the Nova 7s have mixing too if I‚Äôm not mistaken) and the hard case they come with. You might get similar audio from Sony‚Äôs Inzone lineup, but it would have to be something above their H5 (H7 or H9), and you‚Äôd need to know that wireless functionality wouldn‚Äôt be possible with all devices. The Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 occupies a unique space and is truly one of the best bang-for-buck gaming headsets under $200.",5,NA
"94","Headset","Stealth Wireless Multiplatform Amplified Headset","Cuddles","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024","Affordable Excellence","I wanted a wireless headset, but all of the girly, cuter stuff isn't really made for Xbox, so I had to improvise. I wanted something I was going to be comfortable wearing, had decent sound quality and mic, and with long battery life. After researching and watching a few reviews, I decided I'd go this route. There wasn't a lot of feedback because I purchased it closer to when it was released, but I was confident.I'm not a pro gamer (such a newbie), nor am I an audiophile, so I don't really have any complaints about sound. I can comment that I have noticed that the sound isn't high enough sometimes, but I don't think that has anything to do with the actual headset because the headset CAN get loud. It's kind of like when you're streaming a show on Netflix and your TV is at its highest volume and you can barely hear the dialogue; it's not your television that's underperforming.This was definitely the right headset for me. It doesn't look the greatest on due to the design (looks super wide when you see yourself straight forward), but it was advertised as being compatible with wearing glasses, which it is and it's one of the reasons I chose it. That extra space to accommodate glasses is what makes it look weird on. If you plan on streaming and aesthetics are a factor, I'd go with something different unless you're catching yourself at a good angle. If you just want something comfortable that will perform and you can customize to fit your personality, this is a great choice.",5,NA
"95","Headset","Stealth Wireless Multiplatform Amplified Headset","Cuddles","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2024","","I bought this Turtle Beach headset because I was looking for a headset that would connect to both my Xbox and PS5. As soon as I plugged in the included USB, these connected immediately to both consoles. One thing to keep in mind is that these were made for Xbox. Although they connect to the PS5, they don't have complete functionality as they do with Xbox. This is not be a big deal if you are looking for a comfortable headset, and you can live without the equalizer functionality when playing on PlayStation.Headset:The headset is super comfortable. It has a nice cushion that rests on the head and on the ears. The ear portion has a nice swivel that should fit any head shape. It also expands up and down. The power and Bluetooth buttons have different shapes, so once you get used to the feel, you should be able to recognize them by touch. At first I had to look at the buttons since they are flush. I wear glasses and these gave me no issues while wearing them.USB:The USB has two options. One is for the Xbox since this was originally made for it, and the other is simply labeled ""USB"" which connects wirelessly to your PlayStation or PC. No issues connecting to both.App:You can download an app for the headset in order to get firmware updates. This is also where you will use the equalizer function. As mentioned before, all functions are available for Xbox, but when connected to devices other than that console, it will NOT allow you to adjust the volume between game chat and the game sounds (see provided image). It does let you increase the general volume of course. Another cool feature that you can setup in the app is what they call superhuman hearing. This augments the footsteps other players take around you when you are in those intense arena battles. The good news is that you can turn superhuman on with both consoles.Sound:Since this is a fairly new headset, 2024 release, the audio is spatial. I was able to distinguish in-game sounds coming from all around me. If you are big on bass, take caution because these are not heavy on it. The app does have a function that boosts just the bass, or bass and treble together, but even when boosting them I felt that it could be better.Overall this headset is comfortable and connects seamlessly with my devices. The app has some cool features to adjust the sound to your liking and they are also not super expensive. However, if you want sound that will blast your ears into deafness, these are not it. Probably a good thing.",5,NA

"102","Headset","Stealth Wireless Multiplatform Amplified Headset","√Ålvaro Guzm√°n",NA,"Best headset I've ever had!","I purchased these after my existing headphones (Arctis 3) started falling apart (after a fair few years heavy usage).I struggled to find headphones which fit all the requirements I was looking for, which included ability to control music and switch between wireless and bluetooth from the headset, but also reviewed well generally. When I found these they had not yet been released, but I made a note and started watching, and merely a few weeks later they were available.My very first impressions were a little mixed. - Coming from my previous headset, they were much less comfortable on my head. I would find within half an hour I was adjusting the strap forward or backwards as a painful pressure point developed. - The battery on the other hand is astonishing. I set them up and used them for a few days for many hours, and when I checked the battery it was at 90%. I think I used them for around 8-10 days before I felt the desire (not need) to charge them, and they fully charged in no time at all. - The ability to connect wirelessly to my home PC, and via bluetooth to my work laptop, allows me when I need to join a work call to: pause my music, swap to bluetooth (work lappy), pull down mic, and have my call. And then do this in reverse to return to my home PC after. The reason this is important to me, is it avoids needing to use my USB switcher to swap my keyboard/mouse back to my PC to pause music, then back to the laptop again to answer my call.- I thought I needed customizable controls to control media as I didn't see clear mention of it elsewhere, but the options for the two customizable controls are very limited. Media is already built in however to the multifunction button, so perhaps my headset options were wider than I'd thought.I also had a few issues early on, but they only happened once and perhaps have been patched in the firmware or software since: - My headphones stopped outputting sound from any source. I had to do a reset of the device through the app to get it to work again. - The battery indication was incorrect unless you danced about a bit. After running down the battery and then charging ""to full"" it seemed to drop awfully quickly next I checked. I found the battery would charge and claim full, but if I turned off the device and software, then reinitialized everything, it would check properly and realized it was down around 70%.My overall feelings now after having these for months:- I still think the ""hammock"" suspension method is better, but after a few months I can wear them for hours, absentmindedly still adjusting them slightly if I get sore, and can forget to take them off at times.- The battery continues to be fantastic. I generally forget about the battery entirely, and at some point I think ""I can't remember when I last charged these"" so I check and am at 20-30%, so I try to charge them some time in the next few days. They've never run out on me. I do wish the software battery alert was a normal windows notification though. It seems to be a custom drawn one, but it sits behind other windows so unless you go to the desktop you've no idea it's there, so I turned it off again.- I find I often walk around the house listening to music or streaming without taking them off. The wireless range is good enough, though I occasionally get small distortions when I'm at it's limit. It's fine if I'm going to make a coffee or something, or wash up, or make dinner... yeah I keep them on for a lot actually. Or write a review... I've had them on my head for the last 30 minutes with nothing coming out of them; forgot they were there. They just switched themselves off from inactivity.- I'm no audiophile, but sound seems perfectly clear and high quality to me. I don't hear any cracking or other distortions I'm aware of, but as said my bar for sound quality isn't that high really.- The 'flip to mute' microphone only matters in wifi mode. In bluetooth mode it doesn't mute when it's up, or has a separate inline microphone. I wish I could switch this off through settings personally, as I liked that on my old one I could mute and unmute myself from the headset when I needed to talk or listen, rather than needing to use software buttons to do it. It's a minor gripe though. I just have to remember when on bluetooth I'm always audible.So as someone who is not an audiophile, who appreciates battery long enough to forget about, built in media controls, ability to swap between two computers through the headset, and general value for money, I'd highly recommend this headset.",2,NA

"105","Headset","Logitech Wireless Lightspeed Headset","Michael Hassert","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024","","There's no sugar coating here. I bought and returned THREE headsets before buying this one and I was disappointed every time. I was getting mic feedback, breaked up audio, and microphones cutting in and out; and I was spending up to $70 on these things. This is my second LG product and I am once again extremely satisfied with it. It's comfortable, sleek, has excellent microphone quality, excellent audio quality, and the wireless design clears up unwanted desk clutter when you put the headset on display. The only downside to this product is the high price. It's very unfortunate that there are so many big-named gaming headset brands out there like Turtle Beach, razer, Sony, and JBL, but have to pay a minimum of $100 just to get a product that actually works (Unless you're turtle beach. They just never work. No matter the size of the price tag. Don't buy from Turtle Beach.).",5,NA
"106","Headset","Logitech Wireless Lightspeed Headset","Christopher","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022","Best gaming headset I've ever had","I will not add a repeat of the already positive and thorough reviews listed here about this product.  I agree with them.  I take my sound seriously, having been a DJ and in bands in my youth; and can‚Äôt go a day without music.  I was looking for a replacement wireless headset for my computer (Windows 11 laptop) use ‚Äì music, video, and gaming.  I also wanted something I could Zoom with in a quality fashion, as well as reasonable battery life, and comfort was a big factor this time.  (I both wear glasses, and have a large head, and this has been an issue with other headphones.)  I didn‚Äôt want active noise-cancelling, but some degree of isolation is important.  There is also a ‚Äúwork around‚Äù for the lack of Bluetooth which I will go in to at the end of summary feedback.After a couple weeks of a LOT of research and comparison from headphones ranging from $50 to $400, I had narrowed it down to half a dozen headsets, and the challenging part was comfort - hard to verify that online.  I walked into a retail store to try on the headsets, prepared to purchase them on the spot if they fit the comfort criteria.  They had the WIRED version, but not the wireless.  I chose the Logitech G PRO X, came home, and ordered the wireless version, which showed up the next day.Comfort:  Ok ‚Äì it feels like liquid heaven.  These fit and feel wonderful.  Overall, they unit is heavier than my last pair (which was mostly plastic), but it doesn‚Äôt FEEL heavy.  It fits softly AROUND the ear, and I don‚Äôt feel it.  I wear headphones the majority of the day, and above any other factor, comfort and fit can take the joy away more than any other feature.  The oval shape is perfect.  (Any company still making circular headsets need to go back and look at the shape of an ear‚Ä¶) They come with an alternate set of material, so the owner can select whichever feels best to them.Sound Quality:  Very good.  Sharp, precise, and clear.  Candidly:  Does NOT pack the low end ‚ÄúKick‚Äù of my previous (and cheaper) headphones, but the bass is still there‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúhearing‚Äù the low end, and ‚Äúfeeling it‚Äù.  That being said, turning up the low end to ‚Äúfeel it‚Äù on headphones isn‚Äôt the best thing for your ears in the long run, so ‚Äì hey.  The software that comes with it does allow a significant amount of modification with both pre-settings and custom settings for EQ, and other effects, and it is painless to download and install.  I listen from Rock to Classical, and happy with both.Microphone:  Also good ‚Äì by itself straight out of the box, the sound was a little on the ‚Äúthin‚Äù side, BUT, with the customization of settings the software provides, it‚Äôs amazing.  You can record a brief clip of your voice, loop it, and play with the settings until you sound like an announcer for an upcoming movie.  Very cool.  I check out microphone quality with the people I talk with, and they signed off it as ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù ‚Äì so, worked there.Battery Life:  Good ‚Äì When fully charged and monitoring them as I use them, it has been accurately showing 24-25 hours‚Äô worth of life.  I use them long, and hard each day, and could imagine a situation where I could use up to 16 hours of that‚Ä¶ and still have battery to spare.  I have yet to fully test their recharging capability, but initial reaction seems to be that it charges back to a full charge pretty fast.  Candidly, no worries in this department for my needs.  (You can still use them with the USB power cord charging up, so running out of juice really isn't an issue.)Wireless feature:  OK, so this comes with a proprietary 2.4 wireless USB dongle that sticks out an inch and a half, and you have to deal with it (as a laptop user ‚Äì desktop wouldn‚Äôt matter.)  One of the specific issues I was having with my previous Bluetooth headset was that I was running into interference and sound dropping after use, as well as the audio becoming slightly off sync with video after a while, and ‚Äì neither of those are acceptable‚Ä¶ (which prompted the search for a replacement/upgrade.)  Bluetooth is convenient but has its own pros and cons.  The 2.4 system of this is painlessly plug-and-play.  Just stuck the dongle in, turned on the headphones, and they were instantly fully active.  Range of 2.4 is typically better than Bluetooth range, and this has definitely been proven out.  I can wander around the house a bit again, which is nice, as compared to just across the room.WORKAROUND FOR LACK OF BLUETOOTH:As the G PRO X Wireless DOES NOT have any Bluetooth support NOR does it have a jack for a plain old cable, there were two aspects of this headset which were not 100% in sync with my wish list.  (Listen up Logitech!)  I would always like to have the opportunity to have a traditional 3.5 jack to manually wire in a headset.  You just never know when something is going to happen, battery, interference‚Ä¶ but the show must go on.  Without that jack,  it means that I have to maintain an entire backup set of headphones.  Not IDEAL, but doable.  I would hope to never need it, but would like to have the option. However, here simply is no jack, nor does the USB function in that fashion either.  Call me old school, but I like a backup, even if it adds 49 cents worth of parts to the cost.  Not a deal killer however.  Would have let me use it easily with my phone however...The bigger trade off was the lack of Bluetooth (COMBINED with the lack of a wire.)  All indications were ‚Äì (even saw it listed in various reviews) that this meant that the headphone is limited in use to computers and consoles with regular USB ports‚Ä¶ SPECFICALLY, that I would lose the ability to wear my awesomely comfortable headphones while on my (Android based) phone‚Ä¶ meaning that I needed to manage yet ANOTHER set of headphones, earbuds, etc., for taking phone calls.  (I read reviews where this was called out as a specific shortcoming factor.)  THIS IS NOT THE CASE!!!  I came across a reference from a user who used a simple  USB-C Male to USB Female  adapter (available cheap) to connect the dongle to their Android phone‚Ä¶ and I have done the same, and the headphones DO WORK fine for taking phone calls from my phone.  Yes, I have a bit of a weird contraption hanging out of the bottom of my phone ‚Äì but, I am beyond happy with that.  The phone functionality was also plug and play (actually FAST and LESS cumbersome to set up than a Bluetooth headset.)  Plugged in an adapter (<$4 to $9), plugged the 2.4 dongle into that, and turned the headsets on.  Listened to music, sounded great.  The volume wheel controlled the volume on my phone.  Make a call, sounds great.Thought it was going to be a trade-off, but now I can use the same set of headphones on my laptop and phone, and in the end is actually LESS hassle than trying to share Bluetooth between the two.  Just unplug from one and plug in to the other, and off you go.  STILL overjoyed by this.  Candidly, DO NOT understand why Logitech doesn‚Äôt include a simple USB C Male to USB Female with the package (probably would cost them less than a dollar‚Ä¶), and eliminate ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work with phones‚Äù  from the reviews of being a lack of a feature.  Works fine with my android phone with its USB-C port.SO ‚Äì if THIS aspect has been a reason why a person might decide against it,  don‚Äôt let it stop you.  Just spend a couple more bucks for the adapter when you order the headphones, and you can hook an Android phone at least to them.  Hope this is helpful, was almost the deciding factor as to whether or not I purchased them‚Ä¶ and am NOW completely happy that I did.",5,NA

"108","Headset","Logitech Wireless Lightspeed Headset","Jaden","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023","Great headphones across the board, including 1 unexpected (using with phones)","I have to say the battery life with them is really good. I got them out of the box and it was less then half battery but mention having 30 hours of battery life. I believe it can do this because it has no noise cancel function which gives you more battery life. It's a plus on that since charging stuff is annoying sometimes.ear pads which I tried and I prefer the cloth. The generic leather makes my ear warm too fast and becomes uncomfortable. Let alone you have to clean them every once in awhile because of the natural oils of your body.Speaking of comparability the whole headset its a bit tight on me. No matter how I adjust the the head band it clamps on your head somewhat tight. which squishes my ears and I get very annoyed by that. It is good it stays on your head but I can't wear them more than 30 minutes other wise I have to take a break and game or work without them on for a little while once my head has some breathing room.Sound quality, its good for what is worth but sound does leak out. so it feels like you're in a room full of echos. Which is kind of funny the headset is clamped on your head and yet sound escapes. If they had noise cancel chances with it off would still sound great. I'm speaking with past experience use of headphones with noise cancel features when off they still sound great as if the noise cancel was still on. The up side you can still hear people while they talk to you. The down side you can still hear people if they speak to you while wearing them. So what do you need to do? raise the volume and with that I find an issue because anything higher than 15 volume its too loud and my ears are paying the price. But that's just me with sensitive hearing may be different for you. I dislike you can't have an aux input option for the headset yeah it defeats the purpose for wireless but it's nice to have the option if the battery dies you can switch to aux input.Last build quality I don't like how you have to change ear cups. why not make them magnetic or twist and come off. when you got to clean them with a cloth could easily rip off the part that is meant to hold onto the headset. I am speaking in the sense in the future where you've been wearing them for so long so they will be worn out a bit. Also the head band it is flexible meaning you have to place them carefully on a head stand or clear space on your desk. They can probably withstand a drop if you do it by accident but it doesn't feel like it can multiple times if you're someone who drop things a lot. Also if you stretch them on accident ma break it apart. Pretty you have to care for it like its a very fragile baby. Let alone you have to clean them because there is no mention it can withstand natural oils or a bit of sweat. Also you don't want the leather on the headband or ear cups ( if you are using them) to crack after many use and avoid your own oils ruining them. Then again you have to do it with all headphones but some are less maintenance than others.Overall, these are the flaws I found for myself they may be different for you. They may be amazing for you but this long review is for anyone who has similar sensitivity just like I do. Don't get me wrong the price is great and the charging port is Usb type c and thankfully not microusb.it does come with it's natural flaws you would assume come across any headphones a bit of sound cut off and loss of connection which you can turn off and on the headset. It's a standard thing that happens for most headset .My biggest issue for these is the build quality of maybe breaking, comfort, no aux input, its 2023 I get it the age of wireless but wired is still nice to have as a secondary option.",4,NA

"111","Headset","Logitech Wireless Lightspeed Headset","IVAN PENAGOS","Reviewed in Mexico on September 2, 2024","","Estou escrevendo esse review ap√≥s 2 meses de uso.Todas as reviews que eu via n√£o eram √∫teis suficiente. Eram todos baseados em opini√µes rasas falando ""√© ruim"" ou ""√© bom"" e geralmente emitidas por pseudo-analistas-streamers-gamers. As demonstra√ß√µes n√£o eram totalmente reais por conta da edi√ß√£o de v√≠deo e as opini√µes eram contaminadas por uso de Headsets wired.Ap√≥s ler e ver toneladas de reviews de Headsets Wireless, resolvi escrever o meu e esclarecer at√© pra quem tem as mesmas necessidades que eu tenho. Eu vim de um Headset Microsoft Lx-3000 (conex√£o USB), que usava pra jogar e trabalhar, ou seja, um Headset mediano que atendia minhas necessidades.Meu uso:Eu estive procurando um Headset Wireless por bastante tempo por 2 motivos (logicamente com a mesma qualidade ou pr√≥xima do Headset com fios).1. Necessitava de um Headset em que pudesse me levantar da cadeira e andar um pouco enquanto estou em reuni√µes de trabalho (como estou muito tempo em Home Office √© legal levantar um pouco).2. Queria um Headset em que eu n√£o ficasse esbarrando ou ficasse com a sensa√ß√£o de fios pendurados enquanto estivesse jogando.Por esses motivos todos acima, principalmente das reviews in√∫teis que vi, vou fazer a minha baseada nos crit√©rios abaixo:--------------------------------SOM:-NITIDEZUma das d√∫vidas que sempre tenho √© se o som √© n√≠tido. Quando digo sobre nitidez √© o quanto um som √© l√≠mpido, ou seja, um som que n√£o seja abafado do qual voc√™ n√£o consegue nem mesmo distinguir a voz das pessoas (sem considerar a qualidade do v√≠deo e sem controles adicionais).O som √© bem n√≠tido nas configura√ß√µes padr√£o e n√£o fica com aquele som parecido com ""som de liga√ß√£o de telefone discado"". Os fones mais antigos tinham essa caracter√≠stica pela tecnologia n√£o estar totalmente madura, tornando o som com perda de qualidade e com mais caracter√≠stica de ""telefone"", mas o receptor 2.4ghz ajuda bastante nisso.N√£o d√° pra comparar com Headsets com fio, principalmente os que s√£o mais profissionais, h√° uma perda de qualidade, por√©m para um cara que n√£o trabalha com som como eu, √© pouqu√≠ssimo percept√≠vel... mas lembre-se: meu foco √© mobilidade com a qualidade igual ou semelhante ao que eu usava (que tamb√©m n√£o era headset profissional).-VOLUMEA intensidade do som √© algo que muita gente n√£o leva em considera√ß√£o alguns pontos. Muito se depende do tipo de conte√∫do que est√° se consumindo no momento... principalmente v√≠deos. Muitos j√° devem ter se deparado com um v√≠deo extremamente baixo onde a gente precisa aumentar at√© o √∫ltimo volume e logo em seguida ter que baix√°-lo porque o v√≠deo seguinte era muito alto.O volume √© bem cadenciado neste Headset. O que eu quero dizer com isso? Quero dizer que n√£o √© poss√≠vel aumentar demais mas tamb√©m n√£o √© um volume t√£o baixo. H√° de se considerar que √© precisso lembrar aos mais hardcores que o Headset n√£o √© amplificador e que tamb√©m h√° o fato limitador da bateria, n√£o √© ligado a uma fonte de energia (tomada), etc. √â projetado para ser wireless. Embora essa seja a caracter√≠stica √© muito satisfat√≥rio o volume.-CONTROLESNesta parte n√£o sei dizer tanto por√©m h√° muitos controles. H√° equalizadores personalizados no software da Logitech e v√°rias tecnologias embutidas. Ajustei de uma forma que ficasse agrad√°vel aos meus ouvidos.--------------------------------MICROFONE-NITIDEZ DO SOMEsse √© o ponto mais contradit√≥rio de todos os reviews que j√° vi. Ningu√©m conseguiu demonstrar de forma satisfat√≥ria qual √© o verdadeiro som. S√≥ consegui ouvir o som verdadeiro do microfone quando um amigo me disse que estava usando este headset e falando comigo pelo Discord.N√£o acredite nos reviews pseudo-gamers. Eles usam microfones que est√£o muito fora da realidade da grande maioria, sendo microfones profissionais.A nitidez do PRO X √© muito satisfat√≥ria para se comunicar em jogos e trabalhar. Para fazer v√≠deos talvez n√£o seja o ideal (como √© a realidade dos pseudo-gamers) mas para trabalhar e jogar √© muito satisfat√≥rio.O som da voz n√£o fica como se estiv√©ssemos com fones bluetooth ou mesmo em um telefone convencional. Fica com uma boa qualidade e totalmente n√≠tido.√â importante tamb√©m lembrar que o volume da sua voz tamb√©m depende de ajustes do sistema operacional (que muitas vezes interfere pois tem configura√ß√µes autom√°ticas) e tamb√©m do software que estar√° usando o microfone (Skype, Discord, etc).Outra coisa importante √© sempre manter o firmware, atrav√©s do G HUB (software da Logitech), atualizado. Isso proporciona constantes melhorias no som. Alguns dos v√≠deos mais antigos mencionam que conforme o firmware foi sendo atualizado a qualidade do som foi melhorando e este pode ser um dos motivos pelos quais os v√≠deos mais antigos davam um review pior para este headset.--------------------------------ESTRUTURAA estrutura √© bem robusta sendo as hastes que seguram as conchas de metal bem resistente (diferentemente das de pl√°stico do Microsoft Lx-3000 que eu usava) o que j√° d√° uma boa seguran√ßa na hora de usar.Microfone tem conex√£o P2 (aqueles conectores de fone tradicionais de ""pininho"") e √© destac√°vel. Na hora de transportar em uma mochila √© muito √∫til pois eu sempre me preocupava de acabar quebrando em outros headsets em que n√£o era destac√°vel. Al√©m de disso ele √© totalmente articul√°vel. Tem uma estrutura de metal em que podemos dobrar para qualquer dire√ß√£o (tipo aquelas estruturas de metal segmentadas, que eu informalmente chamo de ""cobrinha"").Existem bot√µes na concha esquerda do Headset, sendo elas de liga e desliga, bot√£o de Mute e ""rodinha"" de volume. Todas elas ficam em uma posi√ß√£o agrad√°vel e √© bem intuitivo depois das primeiras usadas do Headset. Detalhe para a roda de volume, que √© infinita, n√£o tem uma posi√ß√£o fixa de t√©rmino, o que √© bastante √∫til pois se tem um controle muito melhor.--------------------------------CARREGAMENTO / BateriaAinda na concha esquerda, tem a conexao USB-C para carregamento, que tem um detalhe MUITO IMPORTANTE. A posi√ß√£o n√£o √© t√£o boa, por√©m √© poss√≠vel fazer o carregamento do Headset ao mesmo tempo em que usamos, o que a maioria dos headsets n√£o faz.A Bateria dura tranquilamente mais de 10 horas seguidas e com energia ainda de sobra. Por experi√™ncia pr√≥pria trabalhando com ele e escutando m√∫sica j√° teve dias em que precisei carregar apenas depois de 2 dias (logicamente com minha rotina de uso).-------------------------------Conclus√£oEu fiquei realmente muito satisfeito com este Headset. Na √©poca comprei pela Amazon mesmo e estava tendo um desconto pequeno (mas desconto √© desconto n√© rs) que ficava por 1299,00.√â um pre√ßo relativamente alto... acredito que poderia ser um pouco mais barato, por√©m pelas funcionalidades que ele entrega estou bem satisfeito por enquanto.",5,NA
