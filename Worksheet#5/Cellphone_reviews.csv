However, two things stood out as particularly annoying. First, when you swipe up to close a window, a screenshot button appears and often gets accidentally tapped, resulting in a bunch of unwanted screenshots in your album. Second, the picture quality is quite poor, though that's expected at this price point. Ultimately, we decided to return this phone for another option.",4,NA

Last one lasted well until dropped right on screen after a gym visit.1. Excellant battery life, often go more than two days without needing a charge. Big plus2. I'm not a gamer, but I do surf and watch U tube a lot. Screen is good, has excellant brightness, but contrast is not as good as with high end screens (totally expected) but I'll keep my cash instead3. Camera is good, really nice color reproduction and good details. Not as clear as my daughter in laws I Phone, but I saved a LOT of money.4. Storage capacity is excellant with the ability to add a compact memory card.  Big plus in my book, these are pretty cheap actually. Amazon Basics microSDXC 128 GB for 12 bucks.  I run a 300GB size because I love videos.

Plus when phone is done you can reused it.5. Size is perfect for fitting into shirt pocket for me at work, even with a case on it.6. Sound is actually decent, but does not emulate hi fi. I realize the phone environment is a huge challenge, but the sound, even with music is not ""Tinny"". Volume is good on highest setting and can easily be heard when sitting on my desk across the room. I've heard phone get a lot louder, but if I want a ghetto blaster I do have some speakers for outdoors and the like usage.7. I'd say you get about 80% of the usage and quality of ""Flagship"" phones with virtually all the functionality at a cost that's about 25-30% of flagship prices. I've had phones fly away riding my motorcycle (Use a GOOD mount lol), dropped, knocked off while working on car and a lot of other usage cycles that are not amenable to good phone life.  For me it doesn't pay to buy top of the line. But I do like having a solid tool to do the job, and this one works great for that.  Stay safe.",5,NA

I've had mixed results with the G Power phones (2020, 2023 and 2024) and while this isn't the phone I fell in love with in 2020, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the 2023 version that made me abandon the brand entirely.Pros:- It'll run most anything fine.- Minimal bloatware on the phone.- Love having a SD Card expansion back to expand the amount of hard drive space on my phone- I like the faux leather back finish on the phone, feels better than the plastic back of most phones and is good if you have issues with phones slipping out of your hands.Cons:- Brightness is all over the place.  It feels like 91% is retina burning and 90% is too dim. Not sure how to get a better balance.- Battery won't come close to what they're claiming; I'm not a power user (1-3 hours a day gaming), but the battery just bleeds life. Can have a full charge at 7 AM and by 4 PM it's hanging around somewhere between 40-50%.Overall, I'm happy to see that this wasn't total junk like the previous year installment of the series was.",4,NA

I didn't think I would like it as much because my last phone was a Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra, but a lot of features between the phones are actually really similar. It's very fas and responsive, super customizable, and has endless features. The camera isn't really the best, but it's above average compared to a lot of other models of Motorola, and the camera is more than good enough for my personal taste, here are some pictures I took with it.",5,NA

I'll admit, I was skeptical at first, but when I bought this it changed my mind. I had a Samsung Galaxy a10 previously, and it kind of sucked. This phone fixed all the issues I had with my old one.  The camera quality is nicer, it has more storage (55 GB), it can run/load any app a lot faster, the battery is AMAZING (I lost 20% in an entire day (however I'm not as active as other people with their phones so take that in mind)), and has a lot of nifty features that you only realize when you actually have the phone. It alerts you when it reaches your normal bedtime, the brightness changes automatically to fit your schedule, it has fingerprint unlock, and you can customize the phone any way you want. The company could've charged any price they wanted, and I'm glad they didn't. This is an amazing phone when it is your first one or when you're upgrading from a trashy one, and the price gives you a lot of bang for your buck.",5,NA

Great price, speed, cam quality (kinda), and everything else!","I received this yesterday and have tried it out for nearly 24 hours now. I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it  would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is  budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!",5,NA

Edwards","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL  ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",4,NA

"28","Cellphone","Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G | 2023 | Unlocked | Made for US 6/256GB | 50 MPCamera | Cosmic Black, 162.83x73.77x9.29","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","","I decided to get a new Android phone to replace my aging Note 9 which was going to need a bettery replaced after serving me well for almost 5 years. I am someone who despises the sound of Bluetooth for music so I knew I wanted to find something modern with a stylus and a headphone jack, since I also despise carrying an extra adapter around and want to be able to enjoy my music while the phone is charging without being forced to use Bluetooth. I didn't necessarily need or want a flagship when I went shopping for this phone, just wanted something mid range which supported the latest 5g, Wifi, and Bluetooth standards, and for a mid range phone, the Moto G Stylus 2023 doesn't disappoint.First a couple of potential negatives for some people: I knew I liked the stylus, but never used the remote function so the Moto G only having a basic stylus without the remote camera function of the Galaxies wasn't an issue with me, but, may be for some users who like the more advanced styluses such as the ones that the Galaxy Notes have. The only other negative I have noticed is that while the 50MP camera is great in bright light, it isn't quite as good as some others in low light, but it's far from the worst I have encountered in a modern phone.That being said, now that I have the potential negatives out of the way, I absolutely love everything else about this phone.It's comfortable to hold.The display is clear and crisp and I have no issues using it in any light level from bright daylight to a very dark room. The display is also great for watching movies and videos, and I had no issues doing some light gaming on it either.The battery lasts roughly 2 days with my relatively heavy use.Both cell and Wifi reception are excellent. I work in some very isolated rural areas  in the Rocky Mountains and this phone works in places where my co worker's brand new iPhone doesn't on the same carrier (Verizon in this case). No dropped calls or lack of 4g/5g service in many spots where his iPhone is useless.The 256 G of on board memory plus the ability to add 2TB more on a Micro SD card is another plus for this phone, my purchase price for it and a 1 TB micro SD card was a fraction of most flagship phones cost, some of which, including every iPhone ever made, don't even offer the option to add storage.Besides for support for additional memory, if you still like listening to music through a standard headphone jack, this phone doesn't disappoint. The sound is very good though the jack, and the onboard DAC and headphone amp seem to have a great frequency response and an extremely low noise floor and no evidence of RF noise or other annoying interference. Another unadvertised, yet pleasant surprise, which some people may be interested in, was finding that this phone has an FM radio tuner on board, a rarity for a US market phone these days. I tried it out and it performed surprisingly well, great sensitivity for pulling in distant stations and great selectivity which allows for pleasant listening when 2 stations are right next to each other on the dial. It even supports RDS which displays artist name and song titles, among other things, for stations which transmit that data.Overall, a very impressive product for the price, great job Motorola!Highly recommend this phone!",5,NA

And it is LOADED with features.","I bought this phone specifically for its wide range of 4G LTE and 5G NR radio bands at an affordable price. The processor is snappy and as long you stick with normal day-to-day activities it and the RAM is more than sufficient. I wouldn’t buy this if you’re a gamer but almost everything else works great. Battery life? Outstanding. Upgrading from a Moto G Power 2020 the plastic back is annoying. I get people don’t like to see fingerprints but the shiny G Power back had a stick to it making it easier to hold. The back on this phone is very slippery and annoying to hold. But a thin silicone case solved that problem. For someone looking for a perfectly capable phone but doesn’t want to pay insane flagship prices I think you’ll like this one.",4,NA

For the value you get on this type of budget, it's a great performer and does everything well!  Only thing I'm missing is the wireless charging, but I'll acquire that in my next phone perhaps.  The display is decent, speakers are loud, bluetooth works well including in my vehicle, NFC is always welcome for convenience.  Screen protectors are easy to acquire and install since the screen's flat, and cases are great for this phone.  I highly recommend this despite having only a couple years security updates available since it's a last year's model; but you can't go wrong for the price!",5,NA

"35","Cellphone","SAMSUNG Galaxy A35 5G A Series Cell Phone, 128GB Unlocked Android Smartphone, AMOLED Display, Advanced Triple Camera System, Expandable Storage, Rugged Design, US Version, 2024, Awesome Lilac","R.T.","Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I've had my Samsung Galaxy A35 for just over one month. I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!",5,NA

I have been using the Motorola Moto g mid range phones for the past five years and decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy over the Moto g Stylus 5G 2024.  I am very pleased with my decision.  The Samsung was slightly more money, but it was worth it,  it offers four years of Android O.S, upgrades compared to only one with the Motorola Moto g series phones,The A35 was very easy to set-up by connecting it to my Samsung Galaxy tablet.  It quickly transferred all of the settings and apps from the tablet.  My first impression of the phone is that it has a brilliant AMOLED display.  It is fast and easy to use, has a better camera system than my previous phone and feels comfortable to hold.  The 5,000 mAh battery charges super fast at 25 watts and lasts a full day.In summary, I am very pleased with my Samsung Galaxy A35 5G smartphone and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a reliable mid-range phone.",5,NA

J. Colorafi","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024","A35 is the Sweet Spot in the Galaxy A Lineup","After much research, trial and error, I bought this phone for several reasons:  1) Good screen size.. prefer the larger screen size than s23 or  s23 fe; 2) Adequate/decent performance specs of processor, camera etc 3) Expandable storage 4) Lowest SAR (radiation) values of any modern Esim phone Ive researched.. Yes i know they say its safe non-ionizing radiation... blah blah.. they said smoking and lead paint were ok too. I use my phone A lot.. tell it to the next guy buddy lol.  5) Price was reasonable enough. Anyway, the phone has been generally amazing so far, much faster and smoother than my old one.  Beautiful screen, although every once in a while some text has a barely noticeable very slight flicker on certain apps/ scripts? I shut off adaptive display something or other, which helped, but again barely noticeable and almost never happens.  Generally amazing, very fast, vibrant, and smooth thanks to the quality display and fast refresh rate.  I used a usb-c flash drive along with Samsung's ""Smart switch"" app to backup my old phone (motorola) then transfer onto the A35.  Esim setup was a breeze on US mobile's warp (verizon) network - so long as you have *this model* of the A35, which is the US Version (The US Version is A356u, NOT the cheaper latin american/ international A356E.. and probably also the international A55 could have compatibility issues too.. I dont know - I believe the a55 is only available in an international version - Samsung wants you to buy thd s23 fe instead.. The US unlocked models will have the best compatibility with your carrier if u live in the US - yes they are more expensive... anyway I digress)  So far this phone has been generally great.  I have purchased another one to have two lines on the A35.",5,NA

"39","Cellphone","Samsung Galaxy A15 A155M 128GB Dual-SIM GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone (Latin America Version) - Blue Black","TravelBug","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I'm Canadian and as of this writing, the Samsung Canada website has no version of the A15 4G phone for sale (international or Canadian branded). The A15 4G international version definitely works on the Bell network in Canada, and the total cost to get it shipped to my door was around $280 CAD for a phone a little over $160 USD. The phone arrive in perfect condition WITH a phone charger within a few days. I am lifelong Motorola user for my personal phone and have a newish S23 for work. At the USD price of this phone, the A15 4G really does blow away competitor 4G phones at this price range, but I was a bit nervous about leaving my 100% reliable, but super clunky Moto behind.There are a lot of excellent online reviews for the A15 4G/5G, but some of highlights of this international version include full 1080 HD OLED display (which is great), 6 GB of ram (most are 4 GB at this $ range), NFC for financial transactions (less common in sub $200 phones), and the promised extended  support for Android updates / security patches. The 4G is also dual sim, but you have to make a choice with the second slot - either a second sim card OR an SD card for more memory.  Whatever version of the A15 4G/5G phone you purchase, read the phones specs carefully. There are a lot of common features between the various versions of these phones, but differences appear to occur. For instance, the 5G A15 is single sim and Samsung states NFC is region specific. The official version of this phone in Canada only has 4GB of ram at this time.So far this phone has worked extremely well, and it is a user experience that approximates my work S23. You are not going to get a great game experience, world shattering photos or film your YouTube  content with this phone, but it is great for standard phone activities. This is a low end Samsung phone, so that requires a little caution. This phone could well have some unidentified issue that will impact all users (e.g. battery probs. or random rebooting etc.) However, off the starting line, this phone appears to be excellent value.",5,NA
