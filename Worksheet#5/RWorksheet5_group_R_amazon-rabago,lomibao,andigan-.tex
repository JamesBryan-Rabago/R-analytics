  The data we have collected consists of 30 products from each of 6
  categories, with details such as product name, price, category,
  ratings, reviews, and description for each product.
\item
  The purpose of this data is for conducting market research.
\item
  The graphs provide insights into trends in pricing, customer
  satisfaction, and product popularity across different categories,
  helping to identify competitive pricing strategies and top-performing
  products. They also highlight correlations between ratings and
  reviews, showing which products are both highly rated and widely
  purchased.

  by price can be done in either ascending order (from cheapest to most
  expensive) or descending order (from most expensive to cheapest),
  allowing users to choose products according to their budget.

snooping through to find Christmas gifts and ended up finding his head set. He’s been gaming more. But he enjoys them a lot! There extremely durable and the battery life is amazing. The volume is high maintenance! And works very well!! There extremely lightweight as well! And the design on them is amazing!! :)

I can tell they are very much worth the money he loves them. The noise canceling is great you can’t hear anything, it’s very light weight, doesn’t hurt the ears or anything, he’s been using them for a little while and so far they work great. Connectivity is perfect the design and cord length are perfect.

                   personally i loved it while it lasted, i play fortnite and i used it for almost a year. it just broke today but probably because i was messing with the chords. so to clarify other reviews, no it doesnt light up unless you plug in the second usb thing. if you want it to light up pretty sure it just lights up with a pc since playstation controllers and nintendo doesnt have that usb plug. i loved the mic quality. super comfy, i used another headset and immediately wanted this one back.

                                                          The headset is very comfy but the mic does not reach far enough for the sound to be picked up from your mouth. The quality of audio is very poor also. Probably good enough just to be heard during gaming but not good for a conference or video call.

                                                     These headphones are amazing! The sound is crisp and when I play all outside sounds dissappear. The noise cancelling could be better, but in my environment that's ok. The mic quality is perfect. Only bad thing is that the cord is too long for my liking

                                               Purchased this for my boyfriend to game on console, it started working good however the audio goes in and out at times like the set loses connection to controller. Other than that it's a nice piece, mic works well, very easily to use and set up, feels light.

seiner Konsole. Da sein altes Headset schon vor einiger Zeit den Geist aufgegeben hat, wollte ich ihm eine Freude machen, da er in letzter Zeit wirklich sehr fleißig war.Ich kenne mich ehrlich gesagt mit solchen Geräten nicht aus aber beim Durchschauen fand ich, dass die Bilder sowie die Beschreibung sehr professionell wirkten, besonders wegen der coolen LED-Beleuchtung. Ich kann jedenfalls bestätigen, dass er mich wirklich nicht mehr hört, wenn er das Headset aufhat – ein gutes Zeichen, würde ich sagen!Mein Mann ist jedenfalls zufrieden und sagt, der Klang sei super, das Mikrofon klar, und vor allem endlich mal wieder was bequemes, da er zuletzt seine alten Handy-Ohrstöpsel notgedrungen genutzt hat.

                         the audio quality on the headphones is good, they’re comfortable and relatively lightweight. only problem is the microphone is not being picked up whatsoever (windows 11, only picking up between 0%-2% of total volume). i have done everything imaginable to sort this out as i am on pc, changed where i plug it in, swapped the cables over, turned it on and off again (age old), tested it on different devices (xbox and ps4) and nothing seems to help. safe to say i am absolutely gutted! first headset ive ever bought and looking at previous reviews i was pretty excited, tested them out as soon as they arrived and have since been let down, hope nobody else faces this sort of problem

The sound quality is fantastic clear, crisp audio with solid bass that makes gaming super immersive. The microphone is great too, my friends say I come through loud and clear without background noise.It’s very comfortable to wear, even during long gaming sessions. Plus, the build feels sturdy and the cool blue design adds a nice touch.

                      Das IMYB A36 Gaming Headset hat mich positiv überrascht, besonders was den Sound angeht. Für den Preis bekommt man einen klaren, satten Stereo-Sound, der beim Zocken echt Laune macht. Explosionen und Effekte kommen gut zur Geltung, und man kann schön ins Spiel eintauchen. Der Surround-Effekt ist zwar nicht ganz auf Profi-Niveau aber für Casual Gaming und längere Sessions vollkommen ausreichend.Das Mikrofon funktioniert einwandfrei – Stimmen werden sauber übertragen, ohne störende Hintergrundgeräusche, was gerade bei Team-Play super wichtig ist. Das RGB-Licht gibt dem Ganzen noch ein cooles Extra und sieht vor allem im Dunkeln ziemlich stylisch aus.Der Tragekomfort ist angenehm, auch bei längeren Gaming-Sessions. Die Polster sind weich und drücken nicht zu stark. Besonders für Gamer, die ein gutes Headset ohne großes Tamtam suchen, ist das A36 definitiv eine Empfehlung wert.

Compound this with a lifetime of audio problems, (hard of hearing), and the speakers are pretty much useless.  A set of cheap computer/desktop speakers were purchased with good results as they had a separate volume control plus a jack for headphones/earbuds.  Having a small desk, It was getting crowded between the laptop, the speakers and the desk light, compounded by the fact that the whole set up is against a wall that goes out to a common hallway.  This restricts my volume as I don't need to have anyone hearing what I'm doing while I am online.  Thus the purchase of these headphones.I chose headphones over earbuds as my ears easily get irritated when something is inserted.  My main concern was two fold. The first is I have a large head, (size 7 5/8) and past ear protection devices have been pretty much uncomfortable both against the ears and overall.  The second is perspiration as sweat build up occurs after extended wear.  Being quite a while since I wore headphones, (2012) I did note an improvement but was still a bit gun shy.To be honest, these were not my first choice.  I initially saw a set of DJ headphones with a 9' cord which appealed to me for freedom of movement.  For whatever reason, these were ordered instead.These headphones came 4 days after ordering through standard, free shipping.  Arriving in a soft pack with a bubble lining, the headphones were in a box enclosed within a sleeve.  This made unwrapping a bit of a challenge as I wanted to save the box in case of return.  Finally gaining entry, the headphones were in a bubble wrapped bag and two sets of wiring were enclosed within another.  It was then I realized my error.  Throwing caution to the wind, I took them out and read the enclosed the multi language manual.  This was helpful as it was discovered that the ear pieces work somewhat like a person's neck.  One side rotating 90 degrees counter clockwise and the other 90 degrees clockwise.  Both tilted both up and down and both have extenders to adjust to the wearer.  Also noted was the padding.  Both ear pieces had generous padding as well as the top of the head set.  It was nice to note that both sides of the ear pieces had outlets to accomodate the speaker wires.  This makes it easier to plug the side in from the source thus avoiding crossover.Two sets of wires came.  The first was a red, stretchable cord with a 6.5mm plug for items like guitars and speakers on one end and a 3mm plug for the head set.  The cord is 2m long but can be stretched to 3m.  The second cord is a 1.2m standard cord with 3mm plugs on both ends.  There is also a "control" button should the wearer have the headphones plugged into a phone.Assembling the pieces, I plugged the 3mm into the cheap speakers and ran a gauntlet of various apps from music to gaming.  WOW! WOW! WOW! A full, rich, clear sound was experienced through both earpieces despite the plug being on the right side.  Every sound was heard, no matter how subtle.  I did note, however, it was a bit "bassy" for my preference, but I was completely overwhelmed by the sound quality.  Wondering if maybe the speakers may have some influence, I plugged the headset directly into the laptop.  NOPE!  No change in quality and I gained a little more cord in the process.After playing for about two to three hours, It was pleasantly noted that the only time it was noted the headset was on was when I reached up to my head to scratch.  Very lightweight, snug, yet comfortable even with glasses.  No sweat experienced.  No discomfort against the ears or atop the head.  The cheap speakers were then moved and attached to another device that also had less than desirable speakers.  It is unknown about the noise cancellation as the residence is pretty quiet with the exception of others going up and downstairs as well as the upstairs resident.  Time will tell.These are definately a keeper.  Even though I have owned these less than a day, I am totally impressed with the looks, feel, and performance of these headphones.  Definately a keeper and highly recommended!!!!04/29/2019 update.  These have almost constantly on my head and I have made a couple observations.  1.  Despite being "full" ear headphones, they are not sound blocking.  On a couple of occasions, I have been hearing knocking on my door as well as the phone ringing and someone talking, even though I couldn't understand what was spoken.  Both have originated about 20 feet away.  2.  the head band has a tendency to slide forward towards the forehead.  I haven't figured out why yet and will post when I do.  Right now I am testing a couple of theories.

dedicated Gaming headphones in almost 10 years. My first set was a pair of Turtle Beaches that had been a loyal companion. I'm a "use it until it breaks" type of person, I don't game very much, however, my turtle beaches started to fade and crackle, and they also went through a fair amount of abuse.Comfort.I never realized how big of an impact a set of headphones may have on the overall experience. I almost went with another set of TBs because that's what I've used but the Quantum 400s were on on sale so I bit the bullet and I am AMAZED. I had about 2 hours before the Turtle Beaches would start to squeeze my head, one free night I had with some friends, I went for 6 hours (with small breaks in between) with no ear/head fatigue. The cups fit right over my ears snugly, and the strap breaths well without putting much pressure down on my head. They're earhugs.Sound.The TBs were as basic as basic gets, the audio was good but very linear, and the upside to them was no third-party app to wake them up. The JBLs sounded tinny and cheap before I downloaded the software, however, plug them in via USB, and VOILA  the software was downloaded and tinkered with, HOLY JESUS. It's an experience for me. The spatial audio immersed me in the game, tuning me into the environment.Mic.The mic is another really big plus for me. And I find JBL makes it hard to compete with them in this regard, the audio is crisp clear, and well-tuned, My mates have no issue hearing any comments or commands in the lobbies.My favorite feature is the lift to mute. That is without a doubt an absolute gem. As a student, I spend a lot of my time in front of the screen, so if I'm not looting for treasures, or getting blown to bits, I'm typically listening to music while I write or watching lectures. Moving the mic out of the way creates a more open atmosphere.Build Quality.The build quality is where I can't provide any insight, they're plastic, and as such encourage me to be extra careful. Some of the joints seem a tad flimsy and loose, however, it seems like the design intends it to pivot easily for less pressure on your head, which is a trait of their comfort.Overall.These are spectacular headphones for what you're spending, they easily check all of the boxes in terms of quality and sound processing.The only thing to note for me is that I will be investing in a wireless set in the future, some days I like to stand while I study or just simply stretch my legs.Nevertheless, in a pinch, you cannot go wrong with the Quantum's.

The volume controls are great, you can balance game sounds, computer sounds and voices from discord with the built in controllers.  They ae comfortable but could probably use a little more cushion on the top of the head, I have a very large head and probably more comfortable for someone a little smaller.

aesthetics, mic, and sound quality of these. My only complaint is a small one, and it's that the material of the cord is sort of scratchy and any time it catches on something, you can hear it in the headphones. Luckily I am often a stagnant creature so this isn't really a problem, and they've worked great.

right.+ You don't have to remember to charge these, and they'll never run out of charge in the middle of something, because they're wired. The cable doesn't bother me, but batteries dying does.+ That means these are probably going to have longer lifespans than wireless ones also, because there aren't batteries to stop holding a charge.+ While I wouldn't use these for serious audio work (i.e. recording or mixing) they are at a good quality/price point for playing games, casual music listening for enjoyment, YouTube, and so forth. The sound is clear, clean, and fairly detailed. They're basically competitive with other headphones in the $80 - $120 range, which these days means they're pretty good.+ They work fine with the M1 Mac, including the "Game/Chat Balance" dial.+ The way that the balance dial works, on Mac at least, is that when you plug the USB cable into your computer, two sound output destinations show up in the audio settings: JBL Quantum 400 Chat" and "JBL Quantum 400 Game". First, set your system sound to the "JBL Quantum 400 Game" output (Or do it in your game's audio settings if it doesn't use the system audio.) Then, go into Discord's audio settings (or Zoom, or whatever program you're using for chat) and instead of using the system audio output, choose the "JBL Quantum 400 Chat". And then, it just works and you can adjust the balance dial to your heart's content.+ The size is adjustable in the usual ways, and they are comfortable enough on my head, even after quite a few hours. This will, of course, vary from person to person.+ I like the placement of the Mute indicator LED on the end of the microphone where you can just see whether it's muted with your peripheral vision, without it being intrusive.- As far as I can tell there isn't a Mac version of the JBL software to do EQ, control the LED colors, etc. This doesn't matter to me, but maybe it does to some people out there.

It reduces background noise by a-lot and ironically works well for business meetings. 5/5 headset. Great product for the price.

Entrega áudio de primeira e um som 7.1 muito bom que funciona bem nos jogos que tem essa compatibilidade. Cabo também é otimo e o tamanho ajuda. Também é muito confortável para jogatinas longas. Só o microfone que não é dos melhores mas atende bem as necessidades de quem só busca uma jogatina casual ou chamadas com amigos

bajar sin querer todo el volúmen y pareciera que no suenan nada, entonces saca de onda jajaja, pero excelentes, su aplicación para PC es muy buena, tiene varios modos de ecualizador y puedes mover la forma en la que quieres que se vean las luces, aunque la verdad nunca las ves porque los traes puestos, sin embargo si alguien te ve se ven muy bien, otro detalle es el micro, la verdad no tiene muy buena calidad, sin embargo creo que está acorde al precio, son robustos, bastante flexibles, las almohadillas no dan calor en absoluto, tienen una muy buena construcción y excelentes texturas, son realmente un gusto el usarlos, los tipos de conexión que manejan son muy buenos, desde Jack 3.5 hasta usb tipo A.

installing the QuantumEngine the sound quality improves a lot, I keep using the USB 3 cable that comes with it. The spatial sound quality is distinctive, I feel like the sound comes from surrounding (of course I have the headset on). I can't tell whether it has noise canceling but ambient noise doesn't seem to interfere with the sound from the headphone...maybe it's loud enough. I don't use the audio cable with 3.5mm plugs as it doesn't allow all functionalities of the headset. Buttons and dials  work only if the USB cable is connected.In terms of comfort, I wear glasses and the headset doesn't my ears at all, the soft ear pieces cover my ears well. The material does allow skin to breathe so I don't sweat after long hour having them on.The mic records high quality sound.A little disappointment, I can live with it, is the mic mute/unmute button doesn't work with Microsoft Teams...meaning that this button doesn't change the mute/unmute in button in MS Teams during meeting.  Hopefully, JBL can fix this.Build quality, it's made mostly out of plastic....feel flimsy...but i will be careful with it.

                                           I've been using these for a little over a week now. They're really light which adds to the comfortability. Usually headphones give me pain from clamping down on my jaw but these don't. Overall, really comfortable. I'm no audiophile but I think the sound quality is great (not using the 7.1 spatial surround sound software). The mic quality is decent. It's not the most clear and crisp mic but for gaming it definitely works well. One of my concerns for how this will hold up are the cable, as it is just encased in a plain silicone/rubber like material and the part where the cable connects to the headset is a little loose. Another concern I have is the fake leather on the padding. There's a good amount of it on the headset and I'm concerned that it'll inevitably flake off. Will try to provide updates on any issues I run into with them. For now, they're great.

headset for my 11-year-old son who goes through xbox controllers and gaming headsets like #00 buckshot through a goose. Sure there are less expensive headsets, but this one is well built and for its price it is shockingly feature-rich.I can't yet speak to the durability; but, out-of-the box, this headset is so nice that I had to have one myself. The sound quality is even better than my $200 Sennheiser headphones and the mic is exceptionally clear (I play in parties with my son) and the flexible mic boom is much more durable than the rigid plastic ones. These headsets are comfortable and the volume knob and mute button are handy and effective. The noise-cancelling is, again, better than that of my Sennheisers.My only gripe is a minor one and that is that these headphones don't fold up for storage, which is not a big deal for a dedicated gaming headset, but might be good to know before you purchase them.

I recently tested the Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset, and I can't wait to share my insights. Priced at just $50 (on sale frequently), this headset offers remarkable quality for its cost, making it a fantastic choice for budget-conscious gamers. Although the microphone quality could be improved, it’s not a dealbreaker, especially if you would consider investing in a standalone microphone.In this review, I will detail the headset's features, discuss its advantages and disadvantages, and provide my overall impressions. Let’s jump in!Design and ComfortWhen it comes to comfort during those marathon gaming sessions, this headset truly excels. It features soft, breathable memory foam ear cushions that conform to your ears, and the well-padded headband ensures a snug yet comfortable fit. I wore this headset for over four hours during a gaming session, and I didn't experience any discomfort.My previous headset (The Razer Kraken) lasted me well over 3 years before I needed a replacement, and that was a headset I used daily. It goes to show the durability of Razer's products for the most part.Sound QualityNow let’s talk about sound quality. The BlackShark V2 X uses 50mm drivers that provide clear audio across a broad frequency range. Whether I was engaged in a pulse-pounding battle or exploring the serene landscapes of an RPG, the audio was immersive. The punchy bass really stood out; it enhanced the depth of explosions and pivotal moments in gameplay.During my sessions, the directionality of sound was impressive. In competitive gaming, being aware of where opponents are is very helpful. The BlackShark V2 X allowed me to easily identify enemy locations and hear important in-game cues, leading to improved performance in several matches.Microphone QualityWhile the sound quality of the headset impresses, the microphone quality could definitely be better. The cardioid microphone is adequate for in-game communication but lacks the clarity many gamers desire. It definitely will get the job done though I wouldn't expect any high quality audio from it.For those serious about gaming communication, I recommend investing in a standalone microphone. External microphones can significantly enhance the clarity of your voice, especially for streaming or content creation. While the mic on the BlackShark V2 X is a bit underwhelming, it won't be a dealbreaker and will function as needed.  I would say that any standalone microphone even a lower end one (Such as the FIFINE Gaming USB Microphone https://amzn.to/4hU3xMH ) will be many times better than most headset microphones.ConnectivityThe headset connects via a 3.5mm jack, making it straightforward to use with various devices like PCs, consoles, and mobile devices. Razer typically includes a splitter cable for separate audio and mic input, which adds versatility for different setups. If your product does not include a splitter, these can be had for well under $5. Of course this will not be necessary if you are investing in an external microphone.You won't have to deal with complex setups or additional software—just plug it in and go. This ease of use is appealing for gamers who want to jump right into action without any hassle. The Razer software is not required, and in my experience their software has not been the greatest anyways.Great Value for MoneyThe most appealing aspect of the Razer BlackShark V2 X is its price. At $50, it provides an excellent blend of quality, comfort, and performance.  While there are a wide range of headsets at lower price points, it's hard to beat the quality and durability of Razer for the price.For budget gamers, this headset is a fantastic deal. It performs well across various categories, providing an excellent investment for anyone looking to elevate their gaming without overspending.Final ThoughtsIn summary, the Razer BlackShark V2 X Gaming Headset stands out in the entry-level gaming headset market. Its attractive design, comfort, and decent sound quality make it an excellent choice for gamers who value quality and affordability. While the microphone may need improvement, it’s not a significant flaw, especially with the option for standalone mics.If you are a PC gamer on a budget, consider giving the BlackShark V2 X a try. At $50, it offers a great gaming experience without draining your wallet. Remember, a good gaming headset can significantly enhance how you enjoy your favorite games.  Happy gaming!

bastante la verdad, buen sonido para jugar en consolas y es lo suficientemente agradable al ponerlo claro que con el tiempo empecé a sentirlo un poco más duro las almuadillas, sin embargo en el tema de laptops es un poco malo la verdad el sonido no se siente tan bien tuve que usar una aplicación para poder mejorar el sonido (Sin usar los cables para el 7.1).Trae consigo una clave para sonido 7.1 en digital para mejorarlo Pero aún así en mi caso no fue suficiente.El cables es muy bueno no se enreda para nada.

                                                    The Turtle Beach Recon 50 is an excellent wired headset for gaming across multiple platforms. The 40mm speakers deliver clear audio, and the removable mic provides crisp communication with teammates. It’s lightweight and comfortable, even during long sessions, and the in-line controls are super convenient. I use it with my Xbox Series X and Switch, and it performs flawlessly. If you’re looking for a reliable, affordable headset, this is a great pick!

for others sometimes (I do this to mess with my friends lol) I don’t know if it’s my controller that’s doing this but sometimes my microphone just doesn’t register sometimes or just stops working (mainly think this is from my controller) but wanted to add it just in case if it isn’t over amazing headphones

I was originally going to go with a different product until seeing that the Ear Force Recon 50(X) series, was to release on 9/25/15. I decided to give it a try, and figured why not. For $40 it seemed like a steal!For the most part, it is a steal.PROS:--The headset itself is good looking, at first I thought the green would be a little off-putting compared to the color of my other accessories and peripherals, but it actually looks really great. Of course, this part is subjective.--Very lightweight. This thing only weighs a few ounces, and other than the light sensation of the cups on your ears, you could not even know you have it on.--The mic is detachable, which is awesome.--Further, the mic sounds great. It picks up my voice with a pretty good clarity for an entry-level gaming headset, and the attached covering of the mic essentially works as a pop filter. In fact, I have a fan blowing right by me and it manages to cancel the vast majority of the wind rushing into it from the fan. Solid mic.--The sound is pretty good. Bass and highs are on par for this price point, with the mids being the weakest link of the sound stage. For music and movies it is probably not the best choice, although it would still work more than adequately for those uses. Gaming is where it really shines, and the sound quality is more than good enough for my gaming needs. Footsteps are defined, gunshots and explosions sound great, and voices and dialog sound just fine.--Adaptability and Connectivity: It connects to the Xbox One controller that has the 3.5mm plug-in, and works on any Xbox One controller with the Turtle Beach or Microsoft headset adapter. My controller has the plug directly on it, so it works flawlessly without the need of an adapter. Further, it includes an adapter to change the mic/headphones to two separate plugs and I tested it on my PC and it works great for both sound and mic as well. Even though it is marketed as an Xbox One headset, it works just fine on PC and my iPhone. I don't have a PS4 to try it on, but I would imagine it would work just fine.CONS:--Like mentioned above, the sound is pretty much on par. Nothing special and certainly doesn't blow your mind with audio fidelity. However for this price range I can't imagine it gets much better. Mids could be a bit better with frequency range.--The cord is rather short. Granted, this model is targeted specifically towards the Xbox One, so plugging it into the controller with the cord length is more than enough, and nice because you don't have a huge bundle of cord on your lap when it is plugged into your controller. However, for use with a PC or other device you might need to purchase a 4 pole 3.5mm extension cable to make it a bit longer. I managed to find several on Amazon for a few bucks, so if this is a problem for you I would recommend going the extension cable route instead of disregarding this headset.OVERALL:I rated 5, but would probably give closer to a 4.5. For $40 (current price at time of writing, the day this headset has been released), it is a great deal. I am very happy with it, and use it as my main headset for my Xbox now, and a backup for my PC. Very comfortable, lightweight, sound is more than adequate in terms of quality, and it works with a multitude of devices. For gaming, it is just an all-around great entry-level headset.

Considering I paid only ten dollars more for these, the difference is staggering.As others note, they're not a top end headset, but for $40, do you really expect that? Sound is clear and crisp. Mic is clear and loud, without being overly sensitive (and the windscreen performs very well), and connects/disconnects easily... I'm actually using Dragon to type this with the mic in my laptops mic port! Some complain that the mic is inflexible, but I haven't found a position yet that it won't accept and stay with. I do, however, wish they had used the jacketing from the PLa line (ribbed, semi-metallic covering that allowed for total freedom of position) instead of the semi-hard, plastic-feeling overmold on this one.Leather-feel ear cups are VERY well designed and generously padded, they feel very natural on my head and surround my ear with an almost hermetic seal... pressing on the sides of the cups while wearing them yields a noticeable increase in pressure in my ears (you probably shouldn't do this).Entire system is very light (due in part to plastic construction, which doesn't come off feeling as "cheap" as other plastic headsets).At 4ft, the cord doesn't give a ton of room, but it was designed to be used with a console controller audio jack, so it doesn't need it... but for use with an mp3 player or laptop, it's great for those that don't need the extra length getting in the way.Some cons:In-line volume/mic control is small and hard to grasp (almost too smooth), and in turn, the volume control knob is very narrow and set deeply in the control box. When you do locate the volume blindly, it's somewhat difficult to roll, but I'm going to assume it will loosen in time. I would suggest moving it closer to the wire's splitter to make it easier to locate blindly, but it's a personal preference some may disagree with.The mic only inserts into the headset in one direction, having a cut out on the mic itself that must be aligned with a tab on the mic jack. It's difficult, though not impossible, to insert it while wearing the headset, so I suggest you choose in or out before you begin using them. I see no reason why this design had to be implemented, and hope future models will omit it.The connecting band has very little in the way of padding across the top of your head. It's not only a very small fill, but it's the same low density, very soft foam used in the ear cups, making it almost ineffective. It's not uncomfortable once you get the fit right for your head (though mine is shaved, your mileage may vary), but it still seems no thought at all went into this design point. Increasing the fill or using a higher density foam could fix this in future models.Each ear cup is connected to one half of the wire, which I personally don't enjoy the feel of, though its double connection design does prevent a lot of twisting that could lead to a single wire design pulling out of it's grommet. The wire(s) itself is very soft and flexible, which while offering comfort, I'm afraid would be easily abraded or pinched.All in all, you would be hard pressed to find another headset that offers more or performs better at or near this price point...it may even be an impossibility. Though PLa's are cheaper and more than adequate, for any looking for an entrance point into the headset market, these are without a doubt the only headset I will ever recommend again. If you need higher performance, just move up the price scale in the turtle beach line, each offering will blow you away.

accesible no sube de 600 pesos, el micrófono para xbox es muy bueno, no tiene interferencias y el audio es impecable que con otros más caros no alcanzarian estos audífonos. Los volvería a comprar solo si los ocupo para Stream pero por ahora solo los ocupo para chatear con amigos en partidas, para Stream desde PC no los recomiendo. Para PS4 o 5 los recomiendo, para tutoriales en celular los recomiendo, para podcast le daría un 8. El micrófono es desmontable y eso me agrada, es cómodo para orejas grandes

      I had a specific need: What's a headset I can recommend to my overseas coworkers (some who mumble with thick accents) that has a VERY clear mic, good headphone sound quality, works as USB-A or old-school headphone miniplug, and all-day comfort... and under $60.We have a winner! I would say this has an EXCELLENT mic (the best I've tested), very good comfort, and very good headphones. I also have Sony studio headphones (no mic), and I am an audiophile who could bore you with the details of why those are better for recording, music, etc. But these Corsairs will give anyone audio listening enjoyment. I'm relatively picky about this, but I do know that for 90% of listeners, these sound good enough to be their only music headphones and they wouldn't tell any difference with my Sony's.Alternatives I looked at:The Logitech H390a is a cheapy, with a very clear, VERY bright (perhaps overly bright for many speakers, but this is a fabulous solution for mumblers) microphone, but stiff headphone pads on the ears. I did a 1-hour call with them, and it was okay... but I wouldn't want them for 3 hours in a row.The SteelSeries Artic Nova 1P - I wanted to love these, comfy, great headphones, but the mic is a little muffled, especially when too close to the mouth. But yeah, nowhere near the mic quality of this one.I dropped a whopping $160 on the Jabra Evolve2 65 - and everyone should know this: 95% of the WIRELESS headsets out there are going to have very poor audio from the bluetooth for the mic. I returned these when I found out. Wanted to love them for their comfort and headphone quality, but the lack of high-frequencies in the mic is a total deal breaker for me.If you want the most UNDERSTANDABLE audio quality for work calls, this Corsair set is the best I've found!  Better than the apple wired set. (which was my previous gold standard, but certainly picks up way more environmental noise.)

They're good quality, comfy, and they don't have that crazy LED-lights-blazing aesthetic that all "gaming" things seem to have.  I tested the audio while playing Minecraft since I already had it open: at first, I heard a bit of static when I turned the volume on high and was disappointed. But  then I used the usb adapter it came with instead of the aux (headphone jack) slot and it sounds very high quality with no static at all.Update: the mic works perfectly! Pretty average quality according to my friends when I asked, but nothing to complain about for regular gaming.Comfort-wise, these don't bother my head or ears at all. They're actually comfortable and completely cover my ears without pressing down on them or moving around a bunch. I don't have as big a head as my boyfriend though- he said he personally found them to be very uncomfortable (he's also used to his nice Cooler Master headphones)  Another thing I took note of was the texture of the ear muffs: very very soft on the part that touches your head, while the sides have a nice-feeling leather material.  When you extend the headphones for a wider fit, the inside part is made of metal which I like and they don't feel loose or woobly at all. These feel like they will last me a long time and I'm super happy with my purchase.Update: use these almost daily and they still look brand new!

To be fair, the maybe 2 hours of day they were used pre-pandemic when I was working in the office was fine.  However, the 8 to sometimes 12 hours a day was not working.  I wanted to find an over the ear headset but didn't want to invest too much into some of the game headsets.  I already have two Sennheiser gaming headsets which fill their role but are on the expensive side.The Corsair HS60 is a good set of headphones, especially if you can pick them up on an Amazon sale.  I have a relatively small head and the headset fits snug.  The top is padded but it can start to bug you if you are wearing the headset for many hours straight (and you have little to no hair for cushion).  You can adjust it so it's not resting on your head but then the headset will lean forwards or backwards which you will feel around your ears.  I've had extended days of working and have worn the headset for almost 10-11 hours in a day.  Not continuously, but total and have had very little discomfort.The sound quality is really good for the price (on sale).  No, it's not going to beat an expensive Sennheiser set, but it does not disappoint with sound quality.  I'm an avid music fan and have not been unhappy with the quality.  Keep in mind, this might vary depending on what you are using to drive the headphones.  If you have an elaborate Schiit system or something higher end, look at higher end headphones.  For normal computer and/or soundcard output, the headphones do really well and have a good range.The mic is another topic.  As you can see from the pictures, the mic is not a boom mic.  It is optional to use and plugs into the headset with a 3.5mm connector.  The headset does not echo your mic through the headset.  Also, these are a close back headset.  This means you can't really hear yourself taking and sometimes has you yelling into the mic to hear yourself through the close back headset.  The other thing is that the mic reads extremely quiet in Windows.  I did some searching through online forums and found this to be common.  Even with the mic cranked to the maximum in Windows, it still reads low when you talk.  The good thing is that I haven't had any complaints of co-workers not hearing me but it does make you feel like you need to speak louder.Since the mic isn't a boom mic, you can't just swing it out of the way.  You can bend it out of the way of your mouth (if you are eating or drinking) but you can't really get it out of your viewing area which may bug you.  Next, when you lay down the headset, since the mic isn't a boom mic it's a little awkward.  If you lay it forward, you have to bend the mic back.  If you lay it backwards, you will move the dial on the back for volume.  If you have a headset stand, then it doesn't matter.The volume dial, this is likely the weakest part of the headset.  The volume dial is extremely easy to accidently move.  The last complaint is the USB cord.  I believe it's got a nylon coating which means it's forever tangled.  I've had similar cords before on other devices and trying to untangle and keep them untangled typically does more damage than good to the cord.  I wonder if some of the reviews complaining about the cord breaking were trying to keep it untangled.Overall, for the money (on sale), it's a good product.  Don't expect $200+ headset quality for $50 (or whatever the current sale price).  I do think at $100, there are some other options out there but at $60 or less, these are good to have in your consideration.

O problema e a qualidade de construção LIXO o arco em poucos meses e falo poucos meses mesmo começou a rachar no meio, e só foi piorando até que o plastico lixo q a corsair usou se partiu por completo. Eu usei uma fita pra colar o arco pois o som ainda e bom e não vou jogar fora. Mas honestamente não vale a pena.

are pretty solid. Sounds good, looks good, and are very comfortable. Small problem though, the microphone is quiet, which was a small problem. I opened my input and output settings and turned up my microphone and it worked great. The cord is decent length, the headset is lightweight, and the headphones have nice stereo sound which gives me clarity in enemy positioning when needed. It also has one of those quick adjust things on the cord, which has a quick mute and a volume dial, all very useful if ykyk.

and he loves it. Good sound quality and he says the microphone quality is much better than his Turtle Beach headphoneswhich we were replacing even when they were new. Simple interface he can plug straight into Xbox to both hear and talk as opposed to his old one that he had to plug into both controller & Xbox. The RGB LED lights are super bright and very cool. He was going to return them when he found out his wireless Bluetooth headphones would work with his Xbox but I had him try them for a weekend first and he decided this gaming headset was too awesome to return despite being wired. Considering he spent his own money, that's a ringing endorsement from an unemployed teenager. 10/10 would buy again.

                                                            I purchased this gaming headset for my husband’s Christmas. He likes to play online video games and was very happy with the quality of sound and quality of this product. The padding around the ears helps isolate outside noise and is comfortable and the padding on top of the head is also very comfortable. I like the esthetic lights around the ear pieces that add a happy feeling. He liked it so much, I bought him a second headset for work to listen to videos and play his games during his leisure time/brain break time there. The lifetime warranty is also a big reason why I purchased this product. I’m very happy my husband enjoys this so much.

Noise cancellation is effective and good for this price.  Comfort leaves some things to be desired (especially my  ears).  The firm fit otherwise is good, but not enough if you have long fine hair to prevent positioning sliding around.  The mic can hear me without picking up traffic noise from several miles away (I can't be heard in person from more than several feet away).I've never quite understood lights on wired headsets, the one very bright one on the tip of the mic boom effects camera exposure settings.  It comes with an adapter for its unified 3.5 mm jack to split the mic and audio into two jacks for older laptops and desktops that require these.  The cable is long enough to keep away from noisy laptop fans, and includes, and has a USB connector to power the lights if one wishes to.  There is also an inline mute switch and volume control so one can adjust to switching between virtual and real world needs without having to open an app or find infrequently used keyboard Fn controls.While I don't see myself wearing this continuously during long flight simulation settings due to the comfort issues, it is suitable for my  many other needs (especially not disturbing neighbors at night with my music or gaming sounds).  I am still satisfied with this purchase, especially the mic's ability to hear me (finally!), and feel  this item is well worth the purchase price.

They are comfortable with the foam earpieces and block out external sound. I ordered these over a month ago to replace a pair of headphones that were terrible quality (headphones I only had for a week). These work just as well as my old Samsung headphones, but at a much lower price. The microphone works well, but isn't designed for loud noises, so if you yell into them it will cause the sound to distort.

The sound quality is excellent, with clear and immersive audio. The design is sleek and comfortable to wear for long gaming sessions. The headsets also have a good mic, allowing for clear communication with teammates. Overall, I'm quite happy with these gaming headsets and would definitely recommend them to other gamers.

Was very pleased with the prompt delivery and and high quality of the product. Great sound quality and microphone audio is very clear! Hardware is also great, comfy on the ears and easily adjustable! Nice thick cable that appears hardwearing!! Very reasonable price for such a good quality product. Would Definately buy again!

The mic picks up on background noise very easily. So when I’m playing COD with the fan on I have to manually switch on and off the mic when talking or else it would be a constant stream of background noise being broadcasted to the match/lobby. The volume isn’t majorly loud when up all the way. But, it is loud enough to hear what you need to.

            In addition to providing a wonderful experience, this headset offers impressive audio quality as well as comfort and style. The sound is immersive and precise, enhancing every detail whether I’m gaming or watching content, with clear highs, deep bass, and reliable surround sound that’s suitable for spotting opponents or enjoying rich soundscapes. A clear microphone makes it easy to communicate, and the soft, plush ear cushions and headband provide lasting comfort, even during long sessions. There is a strong sense of durability in the construction, and the adjustable design fits comfortably. I believe this headset is an outstanding choice for both casual players and daily Zoom meetings!

youtube some times my oculus 2. The rgb works with a smooth fade out loop although it's not addressable rgb it's pretty nice they even send adapters so it you want to power the rgb when your on xbox or ps5 it's independent from the controller power source (batteries) for pc you can just hook it up.Con the volume and mute switch on mine usually faces inward not a huge problem but sometimes moving around with raise or lower the volume a minor inconvenience if I would have designed it one would be on each side instead.Pros decent sound quality yesterday it saved me from being shot from behind in cod mw 2.0 the surround sound is decently crisp. The company is eager to please to to make sure you like it by the time I got it and started using it after a week they were checking up on how I liked it. After a couple messages back and forth he/she told me about the rgb being independent from the jack. Most of the rgb wired headphones I've seen aren't separated and only work on the pc. Now even watching TV (I have a projector) I can use the rgb. Microphone works as it should noise canceling I never hear complains from other players. The top fabric for comfort is comfortable I'm keeping the plastic they package it with to keep it clean. Each ear side get an addition inch approximately of length for people with bigger heads. The plastic ear cuffs are not going to flex unless to beat it with a heavy object the head band has just enough flex to it. And the microphone can be moved as it's flexible but also turned all the way pointing up . The head jack and usb splitter is pretty long about 6ft or so and it comes with a quality velcro cord piece to roll up for non use meaning if you wanted to you could put it on a headphone stand and hide the cords from you cat so it's not dangling.Suggestions to the company slightly thicker ear cups would be nice I got big ears so they kinda touch the inner fabric of the cuff and if I squeeze a little bit there's a little but of suction in my ears. Change the volume scrolling wheel to a sliding one and put it opposite of the microphone mute switch.Possible issues sometimes the microphone doesn't register on cod mw 2.0. However this is more likely to be call of duty chat program than the headphones because it happened multiple times with other headphones as well.

I bought it to replace a Logitech gaming headset that didn’t work for long. The reviews were positive so I decided to try this brand and I’m very happy with the quality. The headphones seem durable, sound quality is great for gaming. It’s easy to connect and use. Great purchase and an excellent price point.

The sound quality it offers for the price is top-notch. Its accurate directional audio is a big plus for games that heavily rely on sound cues. It does the job of pulling you into the game world and helping you notice details such as footsteps or distant sounds that can give you an edge in gameplay.The one issue I've faced is with the USB connection for the headset lights. When I'm playing on my console with a controller, the USB plug dangles as there is no port to insert it into comfortably. It would be awesome if there were a battery-operated option for the lights to enhance flexibility. However, in general, this headset provides value and performance that any gamer will appreciate.

this headset for my daughter so she could talk with her friends while playing on the computer together.  The price of the headset drew me in.  I wasn't sure what to expect based on the price point, but the headset works great!  The sound is clear so it's easy for her to hear her friends and they have shared that she can be heard clearly too.  The headset is also comfortable for my daughter to wear, the light is super fun, and we liked the color choices.  Blue was the winner for my girl.  Would recommend.

                                                         These headphones are amazing! they are pretty cool, I love it when I first saw it. It has two plugs for two different things. It's realy easy for me to change the volume, and you can mute/open the mic pretty easily. Everything I heard from it is really clear, you can hear everything that your friend says, even whispers.  And these are not easy to break, it can really survive from some normal hits.  These are one of the best headphones I've used!

Right out of the box, they offer an impressive range, surpassing even most supposedly certified high-resolution headphones.These headphones are comfortable, sleek, stylish, and very well made. They don’t look like typical gaming headsets; instead, they resemble a pair of Sony or Bose headphones that you can wear in public without fear of looking out of place. Just compare their visual appeal with Sony’s Inzone series or the latest from Bose if you don’t believe me.The cushions are superior to the breathable ones found on SteelSeries and even Razer’s latest Kaira Pros. While the packaging might be a step down from their usual, you’re getting way more headset for your buck this time around.I tested the headset’s Bluetooth range up to 30 feet with no drops or connection issues, even with walls, doors, and furniture in the way. The wireless dongle had a similar range, maintaining a stable connection throughout. I didn’t test if any advanced Bluetooth formats worked with them, but that’s not what they were purchased for. They were bought to replace a broken set of SteelSeries Nova 7s for my niece. I was shocked by how good they sound because you are getting $230+ level sound for around a hundred bucks.The battery life of the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 is nothing short of impressive. I ran them continuously for 25 hours to test for any degradation, and they are still going strong as I write this review. This is particularly notable given the manufacturer's claimed battery life of 80 hours. When we first got them, they were nearly dead, but they fully charged in just a couple of hours. While your experience may vary, my testing suggests that these headsets are built to last through extended gaming sessions without needing frequent recharges.The top leatherette cushion is far superior to what the Astro A30s or new 50s have. It’s actually on par with or better than the Kaira Pro in terms of overall comfort (and no one can deny Razer Kairas are comfortable), but not quite as comfortable as SteelSeries. However, it’s worth pointing out that these are very adjustable and have little clicks when extending either rail, making it easy to ensure both sides are the same length. The headband’s cushion is plush and well-padded, providing excellent support during long gaming sessions. Finally, the Stealth 600 Gen 3 offers a snug (but not too snug) fit and, unlike nearly all my other headsets (Audeze Maxwell, Astro A30, SteelSeries Nova Pro wired, which are the three I use regularly), they don’t fall off my head when looking down.The only con I can think of is that they don’t allow simultaneous communication or mixing between sources. You have to choose either wireless (dongle) or Bluetooth. I don’t really knock it for that because that feature alone usually drives up the cost, and you likely won’t find it on a headset that costs under $130-150. You can keep two sources connected simultaneously though for quick switching, just not mixing so the advertised features might be a bit misleading. On the flip side, unlike most wireless gaming headsets, you don’t have to purchase an additional accessory for them to work with your PS5, PC, or Switch. This headset works with virtually all devices.The EQ customization can be done via PC or Mobile App. While only five or so bands are available to customize, it’s enough for enthusiasts to get the most out of the headset. Many headsets, like those from SteelSeries, don’t even have a mobile app, so Turtle Beach is competing well with the Astro A30/50. The microphone is superior to what’s offered with any sub-$200 headset, and the AI noise canceling makes them on par with the A50s, though still not quite at Nova Pro level.Note: The low latency is the only reason I would ever suggest or consider the updated Astro A50s. I want to point this out because a lot of folks are sold on that headset and it really just isn’t all that impressive. It allows for lower latency because it uses HDMI pass-through (which also requires an additional ultra high speed HDMI included if you want to use it for more than one device), but it creates quite the cable mess and costs 3.5 times more than this headset! While the A50s sound great (superior to the A30 and Stealth 600 Gen3), they do not compare to the Audeze Maxwell. Therefore, I cannot recommend them. In fact, the new Turtle Beach Gen 3 headsets (500, 600, and Pro) make it difficult to recommend anything else if you’re looking for the best value for your money. I’m very curious to see what the new 700 Gen3s will be like because all they can really add at this point is source mixing, which might be worth the extra cost.**Takeaway:** For $100, this is quite literally one of the best gaming headsets you can buy. The only headsets that might be a little better are the Astro A30s or Nova 7s, both of which either break $200 or are very close to it. Plus, the Novas are notorious for having swivels that don’t appear to be lasting, and the A30s’ only advantages are the mixing (the Nova 7s have mixing too if I’m not mistaken) and the hard case they come with. You might get similar audio from Sony’s Inzone lineup, but it would have to be something above their H5 (H7 or H9), and you’d need to know that wireless functionality wouldn’t be possible with all devices. The Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 occupies a unique space and is truly one of the best bang-for-buck gaming headsets under $200.

                    I wanted a wireless headset, but all of the girly, cuter stuff isn't really made for Xbox, so I had to improvise. I wanted something I was going to be comfortable wearing, had decent sound quality and mic, and with long battery life. After researching and watching a few reviews, I decided I'd go this route. There wasn't a lot of feedback because I purchased it closer to when it was released, but I was confident.I'm not a pro gamer (such a newbie), nor am I an audiophile, so I don't really have any complaints about sound. I can comment that I have noticed that the sound isn't high enough sometimes, but I don't think that has anything to do with the actual headset because the headset CAN get loud. It's kind of like when you're streaming a show on Netflix and your TV is at its highest volume and you can barely hear the dialogue; it's not your television that's underperforming.This was definitely the right headset for me. It doesn't look the greatest on due to the design (looks super wide when you see yourself straight forward), but it was advertised as being compatible with wearing glasses, which it is and it's one of the reasons I chose it. That extra space to accommodate glasses is what makes it look weird on. If you plan on streaming and aesthetics are a factor, I'd go with something different unless you're catching yourself at a good angle. If you just want something comfortable that will perform and you can customize to fit your personality, this is a great choice.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I bought this Turtle Beach headset because I was looking for a headset that would connect to both my Xbox and PS5. As soon as I plugged in the included USB, these connected immediately to both consoles. One thing to keep in mind is that these were made for Xbox. Although they connect to the PS5, they don't have complete functionality as they do with Xbox. This is not be a big deal if you are looking for a comfortable headset, and you can live without the equalizer functionality when playing on PlayStation.Headset:The headset is super comfortable. It has a nice cushion that rests on the head and on the ears. The ear portion has a nice swivel that should fit any head shape. It also expands up and down. The power and Bluetooth buttons have different shapes, so once you get used to the feel, you should be able to recognize them by touch. At first I had to look at the buttons since they are flush. I wear glasses and these gave me no issues while wearing them.USB:The USB has two options. One is for the Xbox since this was originally made for it, and the other is simply labeled "USB" which connects wirelessly to your PlayStation or PC. No issues connecting to both.App:You can download an app for the headset in order to get firmware updates. This is also where you will use the equalizer function. As mentioned before, all functions are available for Xbox, but when connected to devices other than that console, it will NOT allow you to adjust the volume between game chat and the game sounds (see provided image). It does let you increase the general volume of course. Another cool feature that you can setup in the app is what they call superhuman hearing. This augments the footsteps other players take around you when you are in those intense arena battles. The good news is that you can turn superhuman on with both consoles.Sound:Since this is a fairly new headset, 2024 release, the audio is spatial. I was able to distinguish in-game sounds coming from all around me. If you are big on bass, take caution because these are not heavy on it. The app does have a function that boosts just the bass, or bass and treble together, but even when boosting them I felt that it could be better.Overall this headset is comfortable and connects seamlessly with my devices. The app has some cool features to adjust the sound to your liking and they are also not super expensive. However, if you want sound that will blast your ears into deafness, these are not it. Probably a good thing.

good for gaming, still figuring out how to use everything, but the connection to the Xbox works good, can't figure out the Bluetooth, they're comfy, definitely sound cancelling, can't hear anything but the game when I have them on, they seem to be a better sound quality as my Astros but not nearly as loud,

The surround sound was impressive and made it easier to hear when footsteps and shots are coming from. The connection was easy and fast and only took a few minutes. The battery is VERY long lasting it almost feels like I never charge it. The software  is user friendly and simple to operate. The microphone sounds great with no issues. The Bluetooth function worked better than I thought it would. As it easily connect to my phone I could make phone calls with the headset. Great headset overall, highly recommend!

por el precio son bastante buenos se escucha muy bien, pero le doy dos estrellas por las fallas que traen no se si solo fueron los que me mandaron pero encontré detalles que no se pueden dejar pasar, uno de ellos es que se desconectan a cada rato de la app y tienes que estar a cada rato conectando (aún asi puedes seguir jugando sin problemas), pero el segundo problema ya no me gustó y es que el volumen se queda bugueado, le subes o le intentas bajar y no hace nada a veces se escuchaba muy fuerte y en otras no se escuchaba nada y en ocasiones ni una ni otra y la última que la caja venía abierta y con detallitos de uso. En general si los compras y no te salen esos detalles te los recomiendo bastante.

When I found these they had not yet been released, but I made a note and started watching, and merely a few weeks later they were available.My very first impressions were a little mixed. - Coming from my previous headset, they were much less comfortable on my head. I would find within half an hour I was adjusting the strap forward or backwards as a painful pressure point developed. - The battery on the other hand is astonishing. I set them up and used them for a few days for many hours, and when I checked the battery it was at 90%. I think I used them for around 8-10 days before I felt the desire (not need) to charge them, and they fully charged in no time at all. - The ability to connect wirelessly to my home PC, and via bluetooth to my work laptop, allows me when I need to join a work call to: pause my music, swap to bluetooth (work lappy), pull down mic, and have my call. And then do this in reverse to return to my home PC after. The reason this is important to me, is it avoids needing to use my USB switcher to swap my keyboard/mouse back to my PC to pause music, then back to the laptop again to answer my call.- I thought I needed customizable controls to control media as I didn't see clear mention of it elsewhere, but the options for the two customizable controls are very limited. Media is already built in however to the multifunction button, so perhaps my headset options were wider than I'd thought.I also had a few issues early on, but they only happened once and perhaps have been patched in the firmware or software since: - My headphones stopped outputting sound from any source. I had to do a reset of the device through the app to get it to work again. - The battery indication was incorrect unless you danced about a bit. After running down the battery and then charging "to full" it seemed to drop awfully quickly next I checked. I found the battery would charge and claim full, but if I turned off the device and software, then reinitialized everything, it would check properly and realized it was down around 70%.My overall feelings now after having these for months:- I still think the "hammock" suspension method is better, but after a few months I can wear them for hours, absentmindedly still adjusting them slightly if I get sore, and can forget to take them off at times.- The battery continues to be fantastic. I generally forget about the battery entirely, and at some point I think "I can't remember when I last charged these" so I check and am at 20-30%, so I try to charge them some time in the next few days. They've never run out on me. I do wish the software battery alert was a normal windows notification though. It seems to be a custom drawn one, but it sits behind other windows so unless you go to the desktop you've no idea it's there, so I turned it off again.- I find I often walk around the house listening to music or streaming without taking them off. The wireless range is good enough, though I occasionally get small distortions when I'm at it's limit. It's fine if I'm going to make a coffee or something, or wash up, or make dinner... yeah I keep them on for a lot actually. Or write a review... I've had them on my head for the last 30 minutes with nothing coming out of them; forgot they were there. They just switched themselves off from inactivity.- I'm no audiophile, but sound seems perfectly clear and high quality to me. I don't hear any cracking or other distortions I'm aware of, but as said my bar for sound quality isn't that high really.- The 'flip to mute' microphone only matters in wifi mode. In bluetooth mode it doesn't mute when it's up, or has a separate inline microphone. I wish I could switch this off through settings personally, as I liked that on my old one I could mute and unmute myself from the headset when I needed to talk or listen, rather than needing to use software buttons to do it. It's a minor gripe though. I just have to remember when on bluetooth I'm always audible.So as someone who is not an audiophile, who appreciates battery long enough to forget about, built in media controls, ability to swap between two computers through the headset, and general value for money, I'd highly recommend this headset.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 There's no sugar coating here. I bought and returned THREE headsets before buying this one and I was disappointed every time. I was getting mic feedback, breaked up audio, and microphones cutting in and out; and I was spending up to $70 on these things. This is my second LG product and I am once again extremely satisfied with it. It's comfortable, sleek, has excellent microphone quality, excellent audio quality, and the wireless design clears up unwanted desk clutter when you put the headset on display. The only downside to this product is the high price. It's very unfortunate that there are so many big-named gaming headset brands out there like Turtle Beach, razer, Sony, and JBL, but have to pay a minimum of $100 just to get a product that actually works (Unless you're turtle beach. They just never work. No matter the size of the price tag. Don't buy from Turtle Beach.).
## 106 I will not add a repeat of the already positive and thorough reviews listed here about this product.  I agree with them.  I take my sound seriously, having been a DJ and in bands in my youth; and can’t go a day without music.  I was looking for a replacement wireless headset for my computer (Windows 11 laptop) use – music, video, and gaming.  I also wanted something I could Zoom with in a quality fashion, as well as reasonable battery life, and comfort was a big factor this time.  (I both wear glasses, and have a large head, and this has been an issue with other headphones.)  I didn’t want active noise-cancelling, but some degree of isolation is important.  There is also a “work around” for the lack of Bluetooth which I will go in to at the end of summary feedback.After a couple weeks of a LOT of research and comparison from headphones ranging from $50 to $400, I had narrowed it down to half a dozen headsets, and the challenging part was comfort - hard to verify that online.  I walked into a retail store to try on the headsets, prepared to purchase them on the spot if they fit the comfort criteria.  They had the WIRED version, but not the wireless.  I chose the Logitech G PRO X, came home, and ordered the wireless version, which showed up the next day.Comfort:  Ok – it feels like liquid heaven.  These fit and feel wonderful.  Overall, they unit is heavier than my last pair (which was mostly plastic), but it doesn’t FEEL heavy.  It fits softly AROUND the ear, and I don’t feel it.  I wear headphones the majority of the day, and above any other factor, comfort and fit can take the joy away more than any other feature.  The oval shape is perfect.  (Any company still making circular headsets need to go back and look at the shape of an ear…) They come with an alternate set of material, so the owner can select whichever feels best to them.Sound Quality:  Very good.  Sharp, precise, and clear.  Candidly:  Does NOT pack the low end “Kick” of my previous (and cheaper) headphones, but the bass is still there… it’s the difference between “hearing” the low end, and “feeling it”.  That being said, turning up the low end to “feel it” on headphones isn’t the best thing for your ears in the long run, so – hey.  The software that comes with it does allow a significant amount of modification with both pre-settings and custom settings for EQ, and other effects, and it is painless to download and install.  I listen from Rock to Classical, and happy with both.Microphone:  Also good – by itself straight out of the box, the sound was a little on the “thin” side, BUT, with the customization of settings the software provides, it’s amazing.  You can record a brief clip of your voice, loop it, and play with the settings until you sound like an announcer for an upcoming movie.  Very cool.  I check out microphone quality with the people I talk with, and they signed off it as “Good!” – so, worked there.Battery Life:  Good – When fully charged and monitoring them as I use them, it has been accurately showing 24-25 hours’ worth of life.  I use them long, and hard each day, and could imagine a situation where I could use up to 16 hours of that… and still have battery to spare.  I have yet to fully test their recharging capability, but initial reaction seems to be that it charges back to a full charge pretty fast.  Candidly, no worries in this department for my needs.  (You can still use them with the USB power cord charging up, so running out of juice really isn't an issue.)Wireless feature:  OK, so this comes with a proprietary 2.4 wireless USB dongle that sticks out an inch and a half, and you have to deal with it (as a laptop user – desktop wouldn’t matter.)  One of the specific issues I was having with my previous Bluetooth headset was that I was running into interference and sound dropping after use, as well as the audio becoming slightly off sync with video after a while, and – neither of those are acceptable… (which prompted the search for a replacement/upgrade.)  Bluetooth is convenient but has its own pros and cons.  The 2.4 system of this is painlessly plug-and-play.  Just stuck the dongle in, turned on the headphones, and they were instantly fully active.  Range of 2.4 is typically better than Bluetooth range, and this has definitely been proven out.  I can wander around the house a bit again, which is nice, as compared to just across the room.WORKAROUND FOR LACK OF BLUETOOTH:As the G PRO X Wireless DOES NOT have any Bluetooth support NOR does it have a jack for a plain old cable, there were two aspects of this headset which were not 100% in sync with my wish list.  (Listen up Logitech!)  I would always like to have the opportunity to have a traditional 3.5 jack to manually wire in a headset.  You just never know when something is going to happen, battery, interference… but the show must go on.  Without that jack,  it means that I have to maintain an entire backup set of headphones.  Not IDEAL, but doable.  I would hope to never need it, but would like to have the option. However, here simply is no jack, nor does the USB function in that fashion either.  Call me old school, but I like a backup, even if it adds 49 cents worth of parts to the cost.  Not a deal killer however.  Would have let me use it easily with my phone however...The bigger trade off was the lack of Bluetooth (COMBINED with the lack of a wire.)  All indications were – (even saw it listed in various reviews) that this meant that the headphone is limited in use to computers and consoles with regular USB ports… SPECFICALLY, that I would lose the ability to wear my awesomely comfortable headphones while on my (Android based) phone… meaning that I needed to manage yet ANOTHER set of headphones, earbuds, etc., for taking phone calls.  (I read reviews where this was called out as a specific shortcoming factor.)  THIS IS NOT THE CASE!!!  I came across a reference from a user who used a simple  USB-C Male to USB Female  adapter (available cheap) to connect the dongle to their Android phone… and I have done the same, and the headphones DO WORK fine for taking phone calls from my phone.  Yes, I have a bit of a weird contraption hanging out of the bottom of my phone – but, I am beyond happy with that.  The phone functionality was also plug and play (actually FAST and LESS cumbersome to set up than a Bluetooth headset.)  Plugged in an adapter (<$4 to $9), plugged the 2.4 dongle into that, and turned the headsets on.  Listened to music, sounded great.  The volume wheel controlled the volume on my phone.  Make a call, sounds great.Thought it was going to be a trade-off, but now I can use the same set of headphones on my laptop and phone, and in the end is actually LESS hassle than trying to share Bluetooth between the two.  Just unplug from one and plug in to the other, and off you go.  STILL overjoyed by this.  Candidly, DO NOT understand why Logitech doesn’t include a simple USB C Male to USB Female with the package (probably would cost them less than a dollar…), and eliminate “doesn’t work with phones”  from the reviews of being a lack of a feature.  Works fine with my android phone with its USB-C port.SO – if THIS aspect has been a reason why a person might decide against it,  don’t let it stop you.  Just spend a couple more bucks for the adapter when you order the headphones, and you can hook an Android phone at least to them.  Hope this is helpful, was almost the deciding factor as to whether or not I purchased them… and am NOW completely happy that I did.

Gaming sounds are fantastic, fully surround sound with directional hearing. I just wish they were louder.

I got them out of the box and it was less then half battery but mention having 30 hours of battery life. I believe it can do this because it has no noise cancel function which gives you more battery life. It's a plus on that since charging stuff is annoying sometimes.ear pads which I tried and I prefer the cloth. The generic leather makes my ear warm too fast and becomes uncomfortable. Let alone you have to clean them every once in awhile because of the natural oils of your body.Speaking of comparability the whole headset its a bit tight on me. No matter how I adjust the the head band it clamps on your head somewhat tight. which squishes my ears and I get very annoyed by that. It is good it stays on your head but I can't wear them more than 30 minutes other wise I have to take a break and game or work without them on for a little while once my head has some breathing room.Sound quality, its good for what is worth but sound does leak out. so it feels like you're in a room full of echos. Which is kind of funny the headset is clamped on your head and yet sound escapes. If they had noise cancel chances with it off would still sound great. I'm speaking with past experience use of headphones with noise cancel features when off they still sound great as if the noise cancel was still on. The up side you can still hear people while they talk to you. The down side you can still hear people if they speak to you while wearing them. So what do you need to do? raise the volume and with that I find an issue because anything higher than 15 volume its too loud and my ears are paying the price. But that's just me with sensitive hearing may be different for you. I dislike you can't have an aux input option for the headset yeah it defeats the purpose for wireless but it's nice to have the option if the battery dies you can switch to aux input.Last build quality I don't like how you have to change ear cups. why not make them magnetic or twist and come off. when you got to clean them with a cloth could easily rip off the part that is meant to hold onto the headset. I am speaking in the sense in the future where you've been wearing them for so long so they will be worn out a bit. Also the head band it is flexible meaning you have to place them carefully on a head stand or clear space on your desk. They can probably withstand a drop if you do it by accident but it doesn't feel like it can multiple times if you're someone who drop things a lot. Also if you stretch them on accident ma break it apart. Pretty you have to care for it like its a very fragile baby. Let alone you have to clean them because there is no mention it can withstand natural oils or a bit of sweat. Also you don't want the leather on the headband or ear cups ( if you are using them) to crack after many use and avoid your own oils ruining them. Then again you have to do it with all headphones but some are less maintenance than others.Overall, these are the flaws I found for myself they may be different for you. They may be amazing for you but this long review is for anyone who has similar sensitivity just like I do. Don't get me wrong the price is great and the charging port is Usb type c and thankfully not microusb.it does come with it's natural flaws you would assume come across any headphones a bit of sound cut off and loss of connection which you can turn off and on the headset. It's a standard thing that happens for most headset .My biggest issue for these is the build quality of maybe breaking, comfort, no aux input, its 2023 I get it the age of wireless but wired is still nice to have as a secondary option.

                                               Relamente me gustaron bastante, se escucha bastante nítido, el precio es accesible a otros que probé, los compraría de nuevo, el micrófono hay mejores la verdad, pero es bueno también. La comodidad de las esponjas muy bien. Con una buena textura y de calidad

Eram todos baseados em opiniões rasas falando "é ruim" ou "é bom" e geralmente emitidas por pseudo-analistas-streamers-gamers. As demonstrações não eram totalmente reais por conta da edição de vídeo e as opiniões eram contaminadas por uso de Headsets wired.Após ler e ver toneladas de reviews de Headsets Wireless, resolvi escrever o meu e esclarecer até pra quem tem as mesmas necessidades que eu tenho. Eu vim de um Headset Microsoft Lx-3000 (conexão USB), que usava pra jogar e trabalhar, ou seja, um Headset mediano que atendia minhas necessidades.Meu uso:Eu estive procurando um Headset Wireless por bastante tempo por 2 motivos (logicamente com a mesma qualidade ou próxima do Headset com fios).1. Necessitava de um Headset em que pudesse me levantar da cadeira e andar um pouco enquanto estou em reuniões de trabalho (como estou muito tempo em Home Office é legal levantar um pouco).2. Queria um Headset em que eu não ficasse esbarrando ou ficasse com a sensação de fios pendurados enquanto estivesse jogando.Por esses motivos todos acima, principalmente das reviews inúteis que vi, vou fazer a minha baseada nos critérios abaixo:--------------------------------SOM:-NITIDEZUma das dúvidas que sempre tenho é se o som é nítido. Quando digo sobre nitidez é o quanto um som é límpido, ou seja, um som que não seja abafado do qual você não consegue nem mesmo distinguir a voz das pessoas (sem considerar a qualidade do vídeo e sem controles adicionais).O som é bem nítido nas configurações padrão e não fica com aquele som parecido com "som de ligação de telefone discado". Os fones mais antigos tinham essa característica pela tecnologia não estar totalmente madura, tornando o som com perda de qualidade e com mais característica de "telefone", mas o receptor 2.4ghz ajuda bastante nisso.Não dá pra comparar com Headsets com fio, principalmente os que são mais profissionais, há uma perda de qualidade, porém para um cara que não trabalha com som como eu, é pouquíssimo perceptível... mas lembre-se: meu foco é mobilidade com a qualidade igual ou semelhante ao que eu usava (que também não era headset profissional).-VOLUMEA intensidade do som é algo que muita gente não leva em consideração alguns pontos. Muito se depende do tipo de conteúdo que está se consumindo no momento... principalmente vídeos. Muitos já devem ter se deparado com um vídeo extremamente baixo onde a gente precisa aumentar até o último volume e logo em seguida ter que baixá-lo porque o vídeo seguinte era muito alto.O volume é bem cadenciado neste Headset. O que eu quero dizer com isso? Quero dizer que não é possível aumentar demais mas também não é um volume tão baixo. Há de se considerar que é precisso lembrar aos mais hardcores que o Headset não é amplificador e que também há o fato limitador da bateria, não é ligado a uma fonte de energia (tomada), etc. É projetado para ser wireless. Embora essa seja a característica é muito satisfatório o volume.-CONTROLESNesta parte não sei dizer tanto porém há muitos controles. Há equalizadores personalizados no software da Logitech e várias tecnologias embutidas. Ajustei de uma forma que ficasse agradável aos meus ouvidos.--------------------------------MICROFONE-NITIDEZ DO SOMEsse é o ponto mais contraditório de todos os reviews que já vi. Ninguém conseguiu demonstrar de forma satisfatória qual é o verdadeiro som. Só consegui ouvir o som verdadeiro do microfone quando um amigo me disse que estava usando este headset e falando comigo pelo Discord.Não acredite nos reviews pseudo-gamers. Eles usam microfones que estão muito fora da realidade da grande maioria, sendo microfones profissionais.A nitidez do PRO X é muito satisfatória para se comunicar em jogos e trabalhar. Para fazer vídeos talvez não seja o ideal (como é a realidade dos pseudo-gamers) mas para trabalhar e jogar é muito satisfatório.O som da voz não fica como se estivéssemos com fones bluetooth ou mesmo em um telefone convencional. Fica com uma boa qualidade e totalmente nítido.É importante também lembrar que o volume da sua voz também depende de ajustes do sistema operacional (que muitas vezes interfere pois tem configurações automáticas) e também do software que estará usando o microfone (Skype, Discord, etc).Outra coisa importante é sempre manter o firmware, através do G HUB (software da Logitech), atualizado. Isso proporciona constantes melhorias no som. Alguns dos vídeos mais antigos mencionam que conforme o firmware foi sendo atualizado a qualidade do som foi melhorando e este pode ser um dos motivos pelos quais os vídeos mais antigos davam um review pior para este headset.--------------------------------ESTRUTURAA estrutura é bem robusta sendo as hastes que seguram as conchas de metal bem resistente (diferentemente das de plástico do Microsoft Lx-3000 que eu usava) o que já dá uma boa segurança na hora de usar.Microfone tem conexão P2 (aqueles conectores de fone tradicionais de "pininho") e é destacável. Na hora de transportar em uma mochila é muito útil pois eu sempre me preocupava de acabar quebrando em outros headsets em que não era destacável. Além de disso ele é totalmente articulável. Tem uma estrutura de metal em que podemos dobrar para qualquer direção (tipo aquelas estruturas de metal segmentadas, que eu informalmente chamo de "cobrinha").Existem botões na concha esquerda do Headset, sendo elas de liga e desliga, botão de Mute e "rodinha" de volume. Todas elas ficam em uma posição agradável e é bem intuitivo depois das primeiras usadas do Headset. Detalhe para a roda de volume, que é infinita, não tem uma posição fixa de término, o que é bastante útil pois se tem um controle muito melhor.--------------------------------CARREGAMENTO / BateriaAinda na concha esquerda, tem a conexao USB-C para carregamento, que tem um detalhe MUITO IMPORTANTE. A posição não é tão boa, porém é possível fazer o carregamento do Headset ao mesmo tempo em que usamos, o que a maioria dos headsets não faz.A Bateria dura tranquilamente mais de 10 horas seguidas e com energia ainda de sobra. Por experiência própria trabalhando com ele e escutando música já teve dias em que precisei carregar apenas depois de 2 dias (logicamente com minha rotina de uso).-------------------------------ConclusãoEu fiquei realmente muito satisfeito com este Headset. Na época comprei pela Amazon mesmo e estava tendo um desconto pequeno (mas desconto é desconto né rs) que ficava por 1299,00.É um preço relativamente alto... acredito que poderia ser um pouco mais barato, porém pelas funcionalidades que ele entrega estou bem satisfeito por enquanto.

Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display (the black areas look black), colors are very poppy, and the 5:3 aspect ratio means you're not losing much space on either 16:9 or 4:3 content.For retro games, let's talk about the processor. It has a Mali G57 MC2, 2 Cortex A78 cores, and 6 Cortex A55 cores. Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup. The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest, cheap, power-sipping technology. While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point.But I'm certain Amazon did this on purpose, and it's responsible for the great battery life, which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet. The modest GPU and high number of "little" cores keep battery drain minimal (this is a 5w chip, in a tablet, where 7-10w chips are the norm) while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks.This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse, as that relies heavily on single-core performance, with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought.So, it's a tablet that just excels at anything where you'll be using the screen a lot. Reading, movies, old games, etc. It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU, but compared to retro games there aren't a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO.The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed.I'm typing this review on the keyboard case, and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor, with short travel and a nice tactile, springy feel. The trackpad is small, but accurate and doesn't "lose" my finger.The stylus itself uses a user-replaceable AAAA battery. I like this decision, because small Li-po batteries wear out fast, and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether you'll be able to find a replacement in a few years. The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet.The stylus is pretty accurate. I don't notice much parallax or judder. My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax. However, there is more input lag than you'll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil. It's a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two. I will mention, this tablet is about 1/3 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life. So it's still better than you expect for the price. But will definitely be more of an "entry level" art tablet instead of something outstanding.All in all, I still think you're getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available. Amazon's reach with e-readers, with keyboards, with stylus peripherals, with tablets, and their resources and supply chain (ie, being able to order unusual tablet SoCs) has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet. I can't really name anything I'd expect to be better for the price.The only real flaw is software; since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store, be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has.

I have always been a kindle user. I must say this is the most superior so far. The speed is great the battery life is awesome. The new pressure sensitive stylus using the artrage app turns this fire into a superb drawing tablet. In my opinion you can't go wrong with the fire max 11. The size is perfect, the display is very vivid, and the speed is fast. The stylus uses a AAAA battery which at first I was disappointed with but it's been over a year and I'm still using the battery that came with it and I draw every day for for hours to a time. Now I see the battery as a plus, as I don't have to wait for it to charge. I assume someday I'll have to change the battery, but the tester says it's still has half left in it. So I'll be changing it next year 😂

I bought the optional keyboard, and it's very functional and well made.  The size is wonderful; it's just big enough.The bad:The sound wildly fluctuates from movie to movie.  On The Lion in Winter, 1968, with Katharine Hepburn, I really had to turn it up.  On Miami Vice the series,I  hardly had to turn it up at all.The search button is very erratic.  It kept telling me I had to purchase something I knew I had already purchased.  The amazing Live Chat at Amazon customer service got it straightened out by telling me not to use the search button, but instead find something by going into My Purchases.  That works, but Amazon needs to either fix the Search button or eliminate it entirely.I've had to become a computer expert not by choice but by necessity, and here are some techie things:You can't change the Silk Browser to a different browser, and if you go to the Internet on the Silk Browser, expect many tiresome ads;You can't use a VPN (Virtual Private Network);You can't block ads if you've purchased the Fire Max 11 version that permits them.  For example, when playing a trailer for a movie, ads popped up.  Infuriated, since I paid for no ads, I immediately Live Chatted Amazon Customer Service and they removed them;Absolutely no printed manual came with this device.  To be fair, that's the rule nowadays, more's the pity.When all is said and done, I really, really like it.  One small gripe, though: I would never have bought this thing and all its' accessories if I was still able to watch Amazon Prime on my Windows 7 laptop.  When I tried, a dialog box came up telling me if I wanted to watch, I had to upgrade my computer to Windows 10 or higher.  I found that irritating, because I could still watch trailers for movies on my Windows 7 laptop!  So, I asked myself, if it can play trailers, why on earth can't it play movies?  But that's a small irritant.  Overall, I really like the Fire Max 11 and all the accessories I bought to go with it.

I’m a solo musician and a side man for others including some large concerts. I researched some programs and tablets that would suit my needs. I find this 10” tablet to be just the ticket. I read a few complaints that it was slow. I find it plenty fast, easy to transfer files from a PC, the sound is pretty good using Bluetooth but better hard wired, no gaps or drop outs in the sound. It’s big enough to read set lists and lyrics at five or six feet. I have also used it for sheet music on occasion with success. All in all a great product and a bargain.

Before this tablet I had the Fire HD 8 2020 and then the Asus Chromebook tablet CT100.  The Fire HD 8 was very sluggish, and I will never go back to smaller tablets because it was becoming unusable, and you could not even browse the web.  The Chromebook tablet was much better and was able to browse the web and use YouTube, but YouTube would hang up quite a bit.  So I finally upgraded to the Fire HD 10 2021 and I am very satisfied with this.  This would be the lowest budget version I would recommend to anyone, stick with the 10 inch version or higher.  I love using this, I can easily browse the web and work on my college classes as well.  I use many streaming services like Netflix, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Prime Videos and Paramount.  I use the offline feature alot for when I travel so I can watch movies on the go.  The battery life is also amazing and charge it about once or twice a week.  My main use is YouTube, so although YouTube is not officially supported I enjoy using it.  I do run into some issues if I am trying to multi task with YouTube and browse the web, or if there are background downloads of videos than YouTube will hang up.  But other than that it works great and I know this tablet was not optimized for YouTube and I think it has about 3GB of RAM.  So the Fire Max 11 would most likely work perfectly with barely any hangups.

Couldn't even tell that it was refurbished. It's very easy to use I've owned a few smaller Kindles and I bought a large one like this a year ago and I took it with me on a trip to my mom's house and showed it to her she had a easy time learning how to use it and play games on it so I ended up letting her keep it. I got this one to replace mine and I love it. Very easy to use to stream Netflix, Disney plus etc on, has a good selection of games on the app store with most being free or cheap but the main reason I bought it is to read books on and comics from comicology.

I was disappointed with its performance. I think it's better to spend a little more money and get a better computer. You cant even play simple games like roblox, the material feels cheap and looks cheap. The resolution is bad, but for just work it's pretty powerful. Just make sure to turn off S mode. I wouldn't buy this if I were you. Unless its strictly for work. I also suggest getting a refurbished Mac air 2013 , old but runs better and looks better than this.

Switching out of Win 11 S mode should be a straight forward process but it just does not work as it should, along with McAfee installed, whether you want it or not.  McAfee acts like a worm virus, intrusively imbedding itself deep into system architecture instead of being a gate keeper like other anti-virus apps.  Windows S Mode dose not allow you to install and run any app that is not Microsoft verified and found on the Microsoft Store.  In S Mode, you cannot install and run any browser other than MS Edge or Bing.  There is an app within the MS Store to switch out of S mode but it will not work because, I suspect, of the bloated software that launches when you first turn on and set up this laptop.  Switching out of S Mode is permanent.  All the advise and direction I found to get this switch to work had failed.  Lots of frustrated people out there with the same issue.  I finally got MS Support on the phone and they told me this is a very common problem with this product and the only way to resolve it was to reset the PC.  A total reset, wiping the OS and all files you may have added.  No big deal as this is a new PC and I did not transfer anything from my old PC.  After the PC was reset, I was able to switch out of S mode so that I now have Win 11 Home instead of Win 11S Home.  At the same time, a McAfee install popup was automatically prompted so I could select Do Not Install.  This was all a bit of a pain but other than that, this laptop is not so bad.  The display colors are not as vibrant as I hoped but with a resolution of only 1365 x 768, I should have expected that.  However, the graphics display very well on a connected higher resolution monitor and it handles steaming video from Amazon Prime Video beautifully.  I hope this information can help someone avoid the frustration of dealing with what was intentionally sold as a very restrictive operating environment.  Getting rid of S Mode and McAfee gives you back unrestricted use of your laptop.One more annoying detail is that, by default, this operating environment is set to save everything to the MS cloud. The default storage of Document, Downloads, Pictures, etcetera, are all MS cloud folders which is where every file is stored unless you go through a few more clicks to store the files on your local laptop drive.  By default, initially you cannot even boot up this laptop without entering your MS PIN to log onto your laptop, and thereby logging into your MS account at the same time.  I found this a bit presumptuous that MS thought this was a good idea.  Perhaps good for their own marketing efforts though, as some bot scans your files for things you do in order to tailor marketing ad pushes to you personally, but I digress.  If you do not want Big Brother holding on to all your personal, professional, private, or other data, then you need to go in to system settings and turn off the MS log in PIN.  Doing so allows you to boot up your laptop to your local drive account only.  You can always log in and log out of your MS account if and when you choose at any time.  Of course, you can even turn off your own laptop log in password so it just simply turns on. without a password.  Your choice, as it should be.

The battery life is impressive, lasting all day on a single charge, so I can work or relax without worrying about finding an outlet. I also appreciate the smooth performance for basic tasks, thanks to its efficient processing power.

There is an error message ever since I opened it that says “Boot Device Not Found. Please install an operating system on your hard disk”. The laptop was already slow to begin with which is why I barely used it. If I had known I never would have purchased them. What a waste of money.

Still in hindsight I wish I’d spent a bit more money and purchased a faster product.

Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop.

Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.

No matter what I did, I couldn't get it to do 2 things at once.  Download a game OR play some music OR browse the web, but never twice at once- Windows 11 in S-Mode.  Need I say more?  It was a nightmare to downgrade from S-Mode, but once it was done, Win11 doesn't seem all that bad, although it does take up a large chunk of the SSD.- Small SSD at only 128G in a time when a 500G drive is only $50.  But what can you expect for a $400 laptop?  128G is only $16

It has more memory than you will ever use for these purposes. But it is inexpensive and doesn't have the great video and sound cards that you need for gaming. Its a decent personal computer. Would recommend.

Computer takes a few minutes to set up, but they all do. Works find & is fast. Only thing & this is my fault for not doing enough research, it has a 15" screen which for me is a little small. I would have no problem buying this brand again just I would look for a larger screen. Nice computer!

It’s nice! I needed an actual gaming notebook vs my Mac because Apple doesn’t support most games in their entirety that I use. If you look in the second picture I set the asus on top of my Mac so you can see the size difference and it’s not that bad. Asus does not have the full screen retna display which is okay but I do like it overall so far day 1

I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a "bling" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running.

No Touchscreen to enable, does not work. Nothing mentioned on site. Only Touchpad is operable, no good for Excel. Very displeased with his model. Only able to use Touchpad not mouse. Difficult to use.

It did what we needed it to for a great price. It came with a junky charging cord that needed to be replaced right away, but that was still under warranty. I purchased it in July ‘22 and now March ‘24 it died. It was inconvenient to wait for a new charging cord and 2 different batteries as I tried to trouble shoot it. Nothing has worked to power it on, and I am not paying asus to fix it as their warranty was less than a year.

I looked at several "higher" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only "missing" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true "lap" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE.

The laptop is sturdy and does the job for us.  She loves the touchscreen option to do her math facts practice online.It is quite heavy but nothing unbearable.I was hoping to load Microsoft Office on it; however it isn’t compatible. I’m a little bummed about that but that was my fault in not researching it more.Still love my purchase.

Maybe that's OK, not really sure. Size,weight, keys,speed,sound quality, ease,battery life, all that is good. Apps work well.

Unfortunately, this one is for the latter.  I purchased this device to begin with as a laptop to be used by my son for Chicago public schools and allow him to be able to access his school work. Upon receiving the first unit physically, the device looks and feels wonderful and within 2 days of starting to use it. The screen was no longer capable for touch capabilities and the keyboard was non-functional as well.  I called their customer support line at Asus and Asus. Couldn't figure out what was wrong either, but I was supposed to pay to send a device I just bought to go have it repaired by Asus and this is why I say their customer service is knowledge below standard but I would say some of the worst there is on the market today.  Amazon luckily was able to step in and send me a new unit as a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is some of the best I've ever you dealt with.  Got the new unit and now this one over here. Can't even stay connected to Wi-Fi. My kid can't do his homework.  This computer is a total piece of garbage even for something as simple as a means to do homework for a grade school.  I will never touch another asus device again and I would advise anyone else that is looking into this product to look elsewhere to avoid the frustration that I'm going through right now

It was on sale via Amazon so I decided to try it…so far we are very happy.  The laptop is utilized by the whole family with each person creating their own account.  I love the Google applications that come with it, so very positive experience so far.  Lite weight, good sound quality, and nice big screen.

I'm not using it to play games or stream movies or take pictures and videos. Though I got the no ads/32 gig model, because reading is serious business.Because it was my six year old Kindle Paperwhite that got me into this. I love reading on it, even library books. This is important, because I'm a writer (The Way of Cats book) and a devoted reader. To keep up with this favorite hobby, I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Still, there are many books, and I also subscribe to Scribd. I have books I own, and books I rent, essentially.Which makes my Paperwhite less of a general reader than I would like. I'm also researching a new book. I can send all these PDFs to my Kindle account, but it's not the same reading or highlighting experience as an optimized PDF reader. In my mind, I'd like to keep these documents, but not on my Bookshelf, mixed with the thrillers and the sciences.Recent thoughts of how long my Paperwhite would last led me to consider e-readers in general. Reading outdoors is combining two of my favorite things, where a dedicated e-ink device really shines, so some kind of Kindle reader is important to me. But I could really use a general purpose reader. This was my first attempt at combining these needs. I am very pleased.The Silk browser, included, let me navigate to the address of the Scribd app (information on the Scribd site.) This let me download a third party app, permission for which I first adjusted in settings. Currently testing PDF readers in the Amazon App Store, for some free books I got in that format.Now I have three readers in one. My Kindle and Scribd books update on my other apps, and I them as I've always done. This screen is as easy to read on as my iPad mini, so no complaints. My iPad is bigger and heavier, with the case and the Pencil, and not something I put in my purse if I don't need to. The Fire 7 works better for what I usually need a purse device for, which is reading and web browsing. My phone is really old and won't keep downloaded books for very long. The idea being that if I'm stuck somewhere with no wifi, I have books in the device. And they will be there.The Kindle app is almost fully operational, but I can't put books into Collections with it, and the layout is subtly different, but it works fine. If it gets confused, I restart it. It's not a high tech device, but it's great for the price.
## 59 I snagged this latest 12 th gen 7” fire tablet at one of amazons sales $39 in late 2023. The latest chip and 2 gigs RAM makes a real difference compared to a 7” fire I had a couple or so years ago. Last one was basically useless, slow, crashed, and the book reader could not even smoothly do page curl turns. BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. IF YOU ARE A BOOK READER I ASSURE YOU THERE’S A LOT TO LOVE HERE. (and see one more surprising positive below in my update). The kindle app is flawless and almost snappy on this device. Page turning page curls are smooth and totally free of stutter or lock up like the earlier generation. It has a LOT of nits of brightness - surprisingly VERY bright even for my somewhat older eyes. Making text a bit larger is great (if your vision can use that help) and the screen resolution is totally fine for reading text, no issues at all even though it seemed like it’s a bit lower resolution in its specs. I leave it full brightness and still the battery lasts forever. Given a choice of the e-ink kindle costing much more, and this tablet (I have both) this little 7” fire tablet is FAR SUPERIOR FOR BOOK READING THAN THE e-ink tablet: it is more responsive, agile in changing text size, and lots of nits of brightness for easy reading. If you buy it ONLY as a dedicated book reader, and especially if you get the $39 price - it’s a steal and an incredibly under recognized useful budget reading tablet. Scale of 1-10 as a book reader I give it a 10. No question.  More pros: surprisingly solid feel, no bending or creaking- really feels solid in the hand. Not too heavy but it’s not like so paper light that it feels flimsy. I recommend you get a case however cheap, because it is a little slippery to hold. Current OS on it is reasonably responsive and has not once ever crashed. Ok now some practical comparisons. As a tablet it is maybe a 4 on that same scale of 1 to 10: it is not super fast opening apps, the selection of fire available apps is poor, and you should accept that this is not a high end android or apple tablet. Yet, several streaming apps work flawlessly and you can watch media on it but the screen is a little washed out on color and lower resolution when your eyes compare to a high end tablet, or iPhone or 4k TV. The silk browser does work, just not super fast. The USB C charging port (!) was a splendid surprise, and the files app built into the OS let’s you surf a USB flash drive you can plus into that USB port which is surprising and kind of really cool FOR A THIRTY NINE DOLLAR TABLET! I did find that USB 3.0 maybe 3.1 works plugged into the USB C port but not USB 3.2. Last note: it has a standard headphone jack. Streaming audio including Spotify through headphones gives very very good sound. Shockingly the OS is sophisticated enough that you can plug a USB C to 3.5 mm female headphone adapter and plug headphones into that and it DOES stream the sound that way to headphones too. Sound quality seems identical either way. Portable, fun, great book reader, quite competent on card game apps and streaming apps including Netflix, Amazon prime, HULU, Disney, other free streamers like Crackle and Pluto and more; long lasting battery life, quite solid, lots of fun and so budget priced that if these capabilities sound appealing just buy the thing you will love it. Great toy to add to the small electronics fun gadgets in our lives.  Update 11 22 23:  one more positive to note: surprising but absolutely true: just discovered that Facebook's Messenger app will handle video calling and the result is extremely good - even shockingly good; sharp image, no dropped frames, perfect clean sound quality. Years ago it would have been impossible to imagine an inexpensive tablet gadget that could do video calls like that; yet, here we are. Outstanding!

Todo lo demás excelente.

The computer is light weight, fast and has a great storage capacity with the upgrade that comes with it.  I really appreciate the 180 degrees option when trying to share information with someone else.  I was also excited to receive a free 1 year  subscription to Microsoft Office 360.  So far, I have been enjoying my time with this computer because it is efficient, fast and easy to carry around.

The computer starts up and all text is in Arabic. Even when you select English as secondary keyboard settings (you can’t set up as main) the keyboard types in Arabic. As a result you can’t log into Wi-Fi for set up connection. Also you need to install the ram and memory (after you set up) which makes the start up significantly slower.

This computer came with separate chips for the extra DDR Ram and the SSD hard drive. These needed to be installed by hand. So if you ordered a unit with the extra RAM and hard drive size you need to be able to install these yourself. Provided directions are fairly good but the details of doing this can be tricky for the novice. The machine is certainly fast enough for routine computer chores...... surfing the internet, paying bills, composing documents, schoolwork, watching a movie etc etc. It is not meant as a unit for processor intensive games, period.  My overall rating is four and a half stars. You could do a lot worse for the price.

For the money it's kinda pricey, the storage is crazy big 1tb, about the battery life is good I keep it plugged in, definitely awesome it has wifi, an Bluetooth, an its light weight, functionality if great. Definitely worth it. If your needing power an speed.

I purchased a Necktac laptop during Black Friday, lured in by the promise of a 71% discount. It turns out this "deal" is a complete sham – the laptop is ALWAYS listed at that price, making it a blatant case of false advertising.To add insult to injury, the laptop itself is defective according to YouTube . I immediately initiated a return with Amazon, but to my dismay, they informed me it would take over 30 days to process my refund, even though the package remains unopened!Amazon's customer service, once a beacon of reliability, has been shockingly unhelpful. They seem unconcerned about the false advertising and the excessive refund processing time. It's disheartening to see Amazon, a company I've trusted for years, allow such deceptive practices on their platform.Buyer Beware: * Necktac laptops are NOT on a Black Friday special. The advertised discount is misleading and deceptive. * The product itself may be defective. * Amazon's customer service is unhelpful and unresponsive. * Expect excruciatingly long refund processing times.Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this product. There are plenty of other reputable brands and retailers out there who won't deceive you with false promises and provide better customer support. Hey Amazon I'm canceling prime and going to Walmart plus. Thanks for not caring 🙂

I love this laptop. It is lightweight, easy to work on and the screen is large and easy to see. This is especially important for me as a Senior. Also, I was pleasantly surprised when I turned on the webcam to make a recording. It was crystal clear!  All in all, I am very happy with this choice and so glad that I bought this laptop. I would highly recommend it!

When I turned it on next, it wouldn’t pick up WiFi at all. I had to reboot and it worked fine but now I’m fearful of this issue right off the bat

I really only needed it for access to software for my Truck. This laptop is very light and I like that the display opens 180 degrees for easy viewing from almost anywhere. I'm not a fan of Windows 11, but I said that about windows 10 too and that OS grew on me. We'll have to see if this one does too. Its plenty fast for my needs and is a good entry level laptop. Would recommend!

I use it for streaming Netflix and watching shows. It’s so easy to use, fast, and synced automatically with my Amazon account. I recommend this tablet to anyone looking for one. Great quality, great picture, durable and heavy duty but light. Easy on the eyes and good battery life.

My husband gets my hand-me-downs, and since had I just bought a new 10" tablet back in February (ocean), he now gets that one and I get the new one (lilac). So we're both happy. We mostly use our tablets for reading, and for that purpose, they work great. This 10-inch tablet is a nice size, not too heavy for reading or browsing the internet. Overall, it is a nice looking tablet at a good price and does what I need it to do. That being said, there are some limitations:1) I'm not much of a gamer, but some years back, I got a few games for free on a Black Friday sale and enjoyed playing them. I also downloaded another game that is free to play. All three of these games worked great until I got to end-game. I then had problems with the game slowing down and even freezing to the point where I was unable to play them to the finish. I tried adding extra storage, even going so far as buying a newer tablet, but ultimately realized that it was a RAM issue. It's disappointing to me that games would be sold in the Amazon Appstore when the RAM on the tablet wouldn't be able to support the demands of the game. There is an upside: I stopped playing them and now have more time to read, yay!2) Even though my tablet is new, it is becoming more and more apparent that Amazon is no longer supporting some of its own apps. These apps are no longer working (although the sites themselves can still be accessed using the Silk Browser): Goodreads, which Amazon owns, so this is really a mystery, especially because so many people do use their tablets for reading; and both the Shop Amazon and the Photos app now take you to the Silk Browser, where you need to sign in each time to access. In the case of the Photos app, it seems to have been replaced with the new Gallery app, but as of this date, Gallery is extremely limited in function. To use a new photo wallpaper, for example, I had to click on the Photos app, sign in, find and download locally the picture I wanted to use, and only then could the innate wallpaper chooser "see" the photo, which was also then available in Gallery. Whew! Prior to this change, the wallpaper could be easily changed in one step, as Amazon Photos was one of the choices, along with the built-in wallpapers, and you could scroll and select a photo as desired.If you're not an end-gamer or don't really need or rely on the built-in Amazon apps, you'll be fine, as this is still a more than decent tablet for the price.

This one works great and so far it does everything I want it to do. The touch screen is responsive and it is easy to connect to my home WiFi. It is easy to charge with the provided wire and wall adapter, and so far the battery is holding a charge for quite a long time. I have been able to use the app store to download apps, I have read books using Kindle and Libby, and I have also used it for basic activities such as games and surfing the internet. The screen is clear and graphics and photos look great. In fact, I'm writing this review with it and using the vocal dictation feature now. I have not used it yet to take pictures. I definitely recommend getting a good Protective case and Screen protector  For this tablet, because it is thin, sleek, and somewhat slippery. It might not be the fanciest one on the market, but I am very happy with it so far so far, especially for the price.

Great for young kids without the investment the "other" tablet maker requires. But the Amazon ads? You have to pay extra to get the ads off your own tablet that you bought with your own money. I don't like that. At all. But, for $80 I guess my grands can learn to live with it.

I've had it now a month and being disabled, I have been using it faithfully every day for many many hours per day. Since I've never had a tablet before I can't really compare it to another.But, there are a couple of issues I have been having and don't know if this is normal behavior for a tablet or not.First issue that is really bothered to me is that after watching a lot of videos from streaming most of the day that suddenly the videos start getting "choppy." This means that I'll be watching a video and it hits a snag and stalls briefly and then starts up and continues to do this nonstop.  It gets so irritating that I have to stop watching videos completely and turn the tablet off.  No, this isn't a WiFi buffer issue.  I have a similar issue with my flat screen TV because it's not a Smart TV, and it's older.  With the TV, though, I'm lucky if I can watch more than a movie before the subtitles go off sync with the video and have to restart.  I'm suspecting that the video stalling issue might be other than the tablet, but don't know for sure.  But, I'll have watched videos most of a day before this stalling starts to happen.  Since I can't be certain if the issue is with the tablet and not the streaming service, I give the benefit to the tablet.The second issue is with the video selection on the tablet.  I'll have the screen with a bunch of squares of different videos to select from and when I select one on the screen, it responds by opening up something completely different that is on a different part of the screen.  Again, I don't know if this is a tablet issue for sure, but it is a little annoying when I'm trying to decide on what I want to watch next and something else pops up that I didn't select.  Also, when I'm watching a video, the tablet doesn't respond always when I touch it to pause it.  Again, don't know if this is a tablet issue or not.BUT, I love both the video and audio quality of the tablet.  I got the tablet for the purpose of watching my streaming videos and it's been a wonderful experience.  One thing that really pleasantly surprised me was the audio!!  Absolutely fantastic!  It's like having surround sound when watching videos!I got the case to go with the tablet as well and it's really nice.  It took me a bit to adjust to the case in maneuvering it in my bed when laying down, but it's satisfactory.  After all, these things aren't really designed with the disabled in mind.  But, it is a nice quality case cover for the tablet.  I have a few cats, so the case cover protects it very nicely against their tendencies to lay atop the tablet.  It's a good protection for falling off the bed when I've fallen asleep!So, for my first experience with a tablet, this is great.  Makes me wonder what took me so long to buy one!

I have found them to be an excellent value for basic use - reading, web surfing, media playback and lightweight games.  I specifically do not use it as a laptop replacement or for hardcore gaming.  The 11" screen is of an adequate size and the brightness and clarity are perfect for indoor use.  Mine has 128GB storage, which has the more useful upgrade of 8 GB RAM, which makes loading multiple programs much quicker.  There is a SD slot where you can add up to 1 TB, if you require it.The subjective speed of the A9+ is a little quicker than my older A8.  One useful throwback feature is that it has a real headphone jack if you happen to have a quality set of older headphones.  The built-in speakers are better than I would have thought - they are quite clear, but there is still no appreciable bass.Idle time battery life is somewhat less than I would have thought but this unit is still new and I haven't gone through that many charge cycles to sort out what is going on.  If you run the battery pretty far down, it can take a while to charge - about 4 hours from 10% to 100% using a Samsung phone charger.

It comes with a lot of bloatware, easily removed, and I was able to easily pair my phone settings to the tablet wirelessly - no problem. Haven't tried using the tablet as a phone yet but I probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside. So far I have enjoyed it, but I am disappointed that Samsung has sooooo many updates that consume a lot of time. I knew there would be a lot of updates when I first turned it on, but several days in I can still expect a Samsung update almost on a daily basis, and this is after I've done all the customizing that I want. Drives me nuts, so I encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to NOT do auto updates or you'll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something!  Do them on command or schedule them!  Samsung - get with it and bundle updates so they are less frequent, albeit more time consuming for each one. Other than that, apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good as are response times when moving from app to app or screen to screen. The battery life has been very good so far, and seems better than my cell phone. One thing I don't understand is why Samsung has offset the search bar on the home screen.....it is off center to the left on the screen no matter how I turn the device. Not a deal breaker but just looks very odd, if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen. The tablet is quite light, very thin, and the 10" size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me. I especially like the touch keyboard that automatically displays with the Google search bar. Once I get past my learning curve, I'm sure I'll have more to say, but all in all, I'm mostly happy with the purchase.

I don't know why all the bad reviews but this tablet is simply beautiful.  Does what it says, and no the setup doesn't take that long but to sync your phone takes maybe 15 min, but the performance is ok, it lags a little when you keep adding more apps to it, durable, screen quality is 1080p, from what I see... overall, not a bad purchase, I just watch movies and Netflix on it and it's wifi and hotspot capable. I'm in the oilfield and it works fine with my hotspot.. works amazing on wifi at home.. again, I would buy another one, just with more gbytes though...

Great picture quality with vibrant color. Easy to use. Good speaker with sharp quality sound. Fast processor good packed with last Android operating system. The battery life is good last for while.  Made with good materials . The last thing is the price is good total worth it.
## 25 Let me just say that this tablet is an amazing value!  I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7, which I paid over $200 for, and have had Lenovo and Huawei tablets...For WAY less than half the price, I now have this tablet, which performs as well as, if not better than the others. I am VERY pleased! I've been using this URAO tablet for about 3 weeks now.To begin with, this URAO tablet came quickly, and the packaging was IMMACULATE!  Had about 85% charge, set up went quickly and smoothly, with ability to bring everything over from other tablets.  While I did not use that option, it was appreciated!  This tablet is just as advertised, and totally performs.The feel of the tablet is SOLID, no fault with its physical build at all.  It's quick in operation with all apps, battery longevity is as described, no issues there, charges quickly.I have noticed that WIFI reception is noticeably better than my other tablets as far as distance from the modem goes, which is a good thing.  Seriously, the ONLY negative about this tablet, to me, is that it REALLY needs to have a good screen protector, the reason being is that, again for me, something about the way the naked screen feels when I swipe to type, or scroll, it seems to be a skittery FEEL.  That was fixed completely by putting on a good screen protector - now it feels perfectly normal, smooth, and the touch sensitivity has not been affected at all by that addition. As a note, I would have put a screen protector on it anyway.One other mention is the resolution...while it IS HD 1280x800, the last two tablets I have purchased are FHD, which is noticeable to me.  But certainly NOT a deal-breaker, at that price.Now, while the TABLET is STELLAR, particularly for the price, there are a couple of disappointments...I do wish there had been a folio case paired with the purchase to consider.  I see nothing.  A case, to me, is a requirement, for protection from drops, etc.  I was able to adapt my old Lenovo case, simply by using double-sided sticky tape on the back of the URAO, and affixing it to the inside of my old case.  Not perfect, but usable.I also wish that there had been a recommended screen protector.  I went out and purchased a 10.1 diagonal, which is just a skosh larger than the screen, so there is overlap. A 10.0 diagonal might be a better shot for anyone wishing to do what I did and add that.*** UPDATE***It's been several weeks, now, and I'm happy to report in looking around again, I HAVE found BOTH a screen protector AND a case for this tablet...links belowhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH2WL1P8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_titlehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH382VH7?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title====================================================================There is one annoying aspect of using this tablet... it is NOT the tablet itself, but Android 14 seems to be significantly different in the way some things work from the Android 12 I am used to.  BUT...I am working through that.  That's on me....This is a GREAT buy, I am TOTALLY happy with the tablet and the purchase. You will be, too...I waffled about making the purchase, simply because I am pretty much a brand name buyer when it comes to electronics, but this is awesome.  It had a lot of verified purchaser high star ratings, few low ratings, the seller had great ratings, and I took a chance.  Yay for me!

It is fast and so far, no issues. The updates all went smoothly and I had no problem downloading apps. The picture quality is fine and so is the sound. The battery drained quickly doing all the initial downloads and it is taking a while to charge. This is not a big deal for me. The tablet comes loaded with Google products and ready to go. Not a lot of bloatware. It is rather heavy so you need a tablet holder for intense work. I haven't taken pictures but did not purchase this for photos. Recommended if you are looking for a cheap tablet.

When I got it I tried to power it on as i need it for my job and it will not power on at all. I thought maybe it needed to be charged. Nope it won't do anything at all. Worst purchase ever. How do I get my money back?

It's slow but that's okay; all I needed was something I could download Kindle to.  After uninstalling all the applications I didn't need it works alright.  This thing can go days without a charge if you're using it regularly or weeks if you're using it once in a while.  I use it to do my college homework reading during my lunch break at work and listen to music on the train and I've needed to charge it once in that week.Be careful with the screen though.  I had the tablet face down on my table and a literal crumb of food scratched the surface. The scratch isn't a deal breaker for me since everything still works but it might be for others.

The replacement is constantly freezing and I don't  have any Social Media or additional apps.  I don't use it much, because it's too slow and and when it freezes, you must click on another Tab in order for you to return to frozen tab, and this will sometimes un-freeze it.  I have yet to watch any movies, just basic internet surfing and it can't handle that.  The battery life sucks, too.  This is not a good Tablet...

Plays games as well as any brand name gaming tablet. I transfered my games from my phone, so as no to tie up my phone. Plus much bigger screen. Love it. And very affordable.

If you clear your caches frequently and/or turn it off often (daily), it clears the RAM and then it works better. It's still on the slow side with only 30% of the storage full, and I'll be upgrading when I can.On the enumerated items below:1. Less of a problem.2. Less of a problem when you learn where to touch.3. Still a big problem.4. See above.===============I purchased this tablet because it had a more current Android version. (Be careful! Some of the others had 4.4 when this one was 10.0!) Unfortunately...1. The screen is lacking responsiveness and drops the contact midway when swiping around (think of a word game where you have to swipe between letters).2. It's very difficult to initiate a touch. If an ad has an X to close, it can take many attempts to actually engage the X instead of going to Google Play to download the app being advertised.3. The screen has a funny feel, and after using a brand-new stylus for 48 hours, there are light but permanent scratches in the screen. (!!!!!) (Fingers are better.)4. It's slow and can't handle some more complicated games, such as a parking lot puzzle game with figures guarding exits.Granted, the tablet's cost was less than $100, but still... I needed a tablet right away and I guess it will work for basic things (I haven't tried it yet with Zoom), but I'll be replacing it as soon as I can afford a better one.

The tablet remains frozen and the reboot stage and continues to loop. I'm not sure if its an issue with the system due to an update or a defect with the product.  If anyone is having this issue let me know. Other than this issue, the tablet was perfect for their every day activities ie. Pictures, games, videos etc.

The performance is good for everyday use as long as you dont expect it to be as fast as an iPad that costs 5 times as much.The only significnat issue I've noticed is:-On USB-C power, the microphone works totally fine and is crystal clear.  When I pull the USB-C plug out, the microphone audio quality has a LOT of interference.  I've been able to reproduce this several times.

This one and the 7 inch both survived an accidental pool immersion, they still work perfectly fine.

You can download an app to your own phone and control the amount of time they spend on the tablet which I find amazing. Plus the ease of not having to worry about replacing it when it's broken due to Amazon's return policy for these. Definitely worth the price.

Im not too used to tablets although I have a kindle. But the setup phase was so difficult and finally after you get used to the double tap after selecting what letter you are going to tap it will tap an extra letter or number and even the password field didn't select a keyboard to put in the password. I kept trying to adapt my double tap to work but it just didnt respond to my double tap to continue with my password. So I was at an IMPASSE.  It was soooo difficult that giving this to a 4 year old when an adult cant even navigate just seemed preposterous and I immediately put it back in the box to return it.

A little hard to get used to and learn how to navigate it as a parent switching back and forth! But it works well and my son loves it! The screen is very sensitive to cleanliness so make sure the screen is cleaned often!

It has 32 GB so it holds so much more than the 16. We were able to put about 2-4 games on the 16 and we're constantly deleting them to add more space. Thus one has more room. The battery lasts forever and it's easy to use.

My 23 yo son played a game on it and said he was humbled by it. Lol. So they are going to be challenging enough for her to not be bored right away. I paid for a year of Amazon kids which was reasonable, and she'll be entertaining for her. You can also download other apps like Netflix on it too.

The initial review was due to the battery not charging after 30 days of ownership and the slow processing speed for watching movies and playing games.I was contacted a couple of days after writing the review from the company. They stated that the issues I was encountering was unusual for the product I purchased and even though the 30 day return window had closed they offered to refund or send me a replacement tablet. I graciously accepted the replacement tablet, but to my surprise they offered to replace it with an upgraded tablet with 2 in 1 android 13 with a 10.1 inch screen. This has a storage space of 128 GB and 4GB+4GB RAM.It’s refreshing  to see that there are still companies who operate with honesty and with Integrity, for this reason I am going to change the do not buy to buy from this company, great customer service, can’t go wrong from buying from this company.I will follow up on the new tablet in 30 days.

The tablet is thin and light, it doesn't look cheap or low quality, but it is way too light makes you wonder if the tablet is made of pure plastic. It feels much better after putting on the silicon gel protector. I got the feeling the plastic stand in the back of the silicon gel will break soon, but we will see. The charging port is USB-C, which is a big plus. The tablet did not come with a charger, only a USB to USB-C charging cable. It charges fine in the USB port on my extension power strip and the USB charger came with an iPhone or Amazon Fire stick. The battery lasts about 4-5 hours, which is not bad at all.CPU model is indeed SC7731E, but it Quad-Core ARM Cortex A7 runs at 1.3GHz instead of Quad-Core ARM CortexTM A55 MP8 at 1.4GHz stated in the description. Total RAM is 2Gb instead of 3Gb in description and internal storage is indeed 64Gb. Screen size 10.1 1280x800 resolution as stated. GPS functions correctly, Wifi only supports 2.4 GHz and can not detect 5 GHz wifi, which is the major significant downside of this tablet. The download speed for Wi-Fi is about 5.8mbps while my iPhone gets 104mbps when connected to the same router but 5GHz Wi-Fi. Basically, you get what you paid for. The description stated configuration is not realistic in the $50 price range at this moment TBH.Set the specs aside, the performance of this tablet is ok, very ok. I mean you don't feel the responsiveness you get on your iPhone for sure, but you don't feel it is terribly slow either. It will become very slow if you install too many apps or run out of internal storage space, so you need to have a clear definition of what apps you want to keep on this tablet. I keep YouTube, Kindle, PrimeVideo, VLC, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, etc. because I define it as reading and video streaming devices. Light games such as Sudoku, Water Sort, and Plant vs. Zombie work just fine.This tablet came with the app iWawa, which is an educational app for kids. This app makes me wish I had bought this tablet earlier. If you have an Android tablet, check if you can install this app, highly recommended for babies and kids. Sadly it is not available for iPhone or iPad, but now I'm glad I bought this tablet. My original plan is to use this low-end Android tablet as a reading, shopping, and video streaming device while I do my game mission on my iPhone, now I have to do all this on my daughter's iPad Air3.In summary, screw the specs, if you have kids 2-8 years old, and you want a cheap but reasonable quality Android tablet to run iWawa, this one is more than good enough. It also works as a good enough low-end Android tablet as a reading, shopping, YouTube, and video streaming device, whenever your kids are not allowed to use the tablet.

It's a little laggy on bootup, but after a few minutes it runs fine. I've had this tablet for about four months now and use it mainly to watch videos and surf. I don't play games so I can't speak to that. As an e-reader is great.  It multitasks fine as well.

Definitely worth the price at the point.  With the S-Pen and the good usability of the tablet, I find it very useful for browsing and doing minor edits in Google Docs, etc.  The battery life is pretty decent, and the screen and sound is pretty good for watching videos.  Better than the Kindle 10 fire.So if you only want to watch videos / browse and not do much else, buying a Kindle 10 Fire on discount is probably a better deal.  Though if you want to do more productivity stuff, the S-Pen that comes with it is very handy.  There are plenty of affordable and sturdy cases for this device that will also hold the pen.In terms of speed, it works fine.  But if you've used an iPad Pro, you will notice it has more of a lag when loading new web pages.  Not enough to matter, but to be noted if you're used to the rapid loading speeds. Upon initial device setup, there's a lot of software updates, etc. which makes the lag more noticeable until they're all done.Finally, you can also consider the Samsung FE tablet, which is more premium table for more money.  I ended up sticking with this one, not because of the price, but because that one is about 20% heavier, and this lightweight tablet made it so easy to carry and use.  Also, there are sometimes trade programs to get the FE tablet.  If you use this one for a few years, then pay a little bit to get more for a new FE tablet, then it's an even better deal.  But you can't go wrong with the FE tablet now too if you're in the market for a more powerful device.

It's been a while since I've looked into drawing tablets - back in the day if you wanted a good tablet for drawing you got a mid screen and all it did was draw.  No internet, nothing.  This is a full fat tablet (that basically does the role of a desktop or laptop for your average user) and it has a great pen experience.  I've been drawing with krita, which is a very feature dense program and there is no lag.The other thing it does great is media.  The screen is awesome and the speakers are surprisingly loud.  Because it's in the android ecosystem you can run Firefox as your browser and get ublock origin meaning you never have to see ads as long as you're using Firefox (notably for YouTube). The tablet also natively will keep playing YouTube when you turn off the screen.  Or at least it does with Firefox - never had any desire to download the app, frankly.  The screen is big enough to be a significant improvement over even a large phone. But not so big that it feels hard to be portable.The other half of media is games.  Obviously this is not a gaming PC.  It's not going to run any real heavy duty games.  But if you want it for mobile games especially card games like slay the spire, legends of runeterra, or hearthstone, then this is just basically the perfect device for them.  The screen has great color and contrast, so since graphical fidelity is not the limiter with these, they can actually look better on this than a PC because the screen is great.  It's also basically the perfect size for card games.  Large enough to feel like the full primo experience, but small enough you don't feel like you are dragging your finger across miles of realestate for every action.Seems the one place that isn't amazing is the battery.  The battery is fine.  It's not bad, it's not great.  It will last you long enough, but it's not going to knock your socks off.Unless you have a really specific reason that you absolutely NEED a larger screen or something, I can't really imagine recommending a different tablet at the moment.

It is a great tablet at a reasonable price.The only negative is that the pen skips when drawing.  I decided to purchase a V-Pen to see if it was the pen or the tablet causing the problem, and the V-Pen works flawlessly with my drawing apps.  I was relieved to discover the problem was just the S pen. Product support (Samsung and Amazon) confirmed that I would have to send the tablet back in order to get a new pen (and tablet), which is the last thing I wanted to do after I had it all set up, so I decided to purchase some pen tips for the S pen to see if that fixes the problem.  The tip is wobbly, and I don't know enough about these pens to know whether or not that is normal. It's not really a problem because I like the V-Pen a lot,  but it would be nice to have a backup and know what was wrong with the S pen. (No, I'm affiliated with V Pen, it was a good choice for me!) I didn't see a need to give the tablet a less than 5 star rating because of the pen - the tablet is great, just be aware of the fact that the tablet has to go back too in the event the pen has issues and you need a new one. 5 stars!

An updated version of the same model  in 2022, this is still better than the A series, if you are looking for low-mid range performance.

The phone app recognized it immediately and it works perfectly.  This is a good upgrade from the Mini original that has also been working flawlessly for several years.  Better picture, small spotlight, and the black color is easier to hide from my dog Roscoe!  In fact, I call it my "Roscoe cam" as I use it to monitor him when I'm away.  The motion sensing function is excellent, and the camera comes up in the app quickly.  I had to turn off the notification option, as Roscoe was triggering the camera and sending a notification to my phone every few minutes when home alone.  Easy to do in the app.  Really good quality device, especially considering it doesn't break the bank!!

We got a Black Friday deal that came with 2 cameras and a module. We have had them for almost a week now and have had no problems. No lost wifi  connection, motion detection alerts and pictures and live view are great. We are very happy with Blink and plan to purchase some additional devices.installation was very easy!

I avidly used the Blink (first gen) indoor cameras to keep an eye out on my cats as well as any possible intruders.The first gen worked so well for me that I thought I should give the Blink 2 a try. They did not disappoint. Better picture quality AND it tells you the different type of motion in your home (whether it’s an animal or a person or a dust bunny caught on camera).I also have the Blink Doorbell and the App interface pairs perfectly with the entire camera system.If you want reliability that’s worth the price, this camera is the way to go.

Over all good. Clear pictures. Night vision. The outdoor ones also include a bright light of needed or set with "motion". Timer options. Good feature. Sounds is good a bit low and some lag on the talking feature but decent. Can live view. Have multiple cameras in a group. Only cons are , they go "offline" randomly and nothing can do ton reset remotely. Have to come home, unplug n plug. Not very useful if away from home/ vacation. Also can not continuously live view. I believe it's 3 or 5 min intervals then have to go back in to the camera. For the price and what it can do, it's worth it. I have 6.

So during Prime days...I jumped on the Blink bandwagon and boy and I glad I did.  I haven't had a single issue to date.  I've even ordered more cameras.  They're fantastic!  The resolution is great and the options you have in the setup is great.  You can turn the LED indicators off so it's not obvious the camera is on, you can turn the sound off, and a whole lot more.  They work great in the dark too!  I've got one indoor cam, a doorbell camera, the wired floodlight camera, and two outdoor cameras.  And the app is great too!

The camera is compact and easy to set up—just plug it in, connect to the app, and you’re good to go. The HD video quality is excellent, and I love that I can see clearly even at night thanks to the night vision feature.What’s great is how customizable the settings are. I can adjust the motion detection zones to avoid unnecessary alerts, and the two-way audio lets me communicate with anyone at my door, which is a huge plus. Plus, the app is intuitive and lets me check the camera feed anytime, anywhere.The only downside is that it needs to be plugged in, so you have to place it near a power source, but that’s a small trade-off for the great performance. Overall, the Blink Mini 2 is a solid, affordable option for home security. Highly recommend!

These little wired cameras are GREAT.  I just love them.  Great picture, quick notification of any motion - often while the video is still recording too!!  I put together a nice set of cameras for my entire home, the app works great, and I even decided to sign up for the yearly subscription too.  Great peace of mind and latest technology too.  Thank you, Blink!

It is so similar, making the learning curve easy. The photos are sharper than my old camera. Very pleased with purchase.

I am a house flipper and now a realtor.  I work with a bank, so that I go wherever their foreclosure happens to be.  With large towns, it is easy to find a photographer but in a small town they want hundreds of dollars more for less work (no competition).  My photographer put this in my cart with a special lens n I take my own photos when I am too far away from him.  They look good.  It has saved me much more money than it cost, that is for sure!

I purchased the Canon TR7.  Trying to learn the different things it will do. It makes real good pictures.  It is easier to use when you figure it out

You don’t have to be a photographer to figure it out & use it. Quality of pictures is good even with using the preset settings. The WiFi connectivity feature is great for ease of transferring photos from the camera to your phone easily without the hassle of taking of the card and putting into the laptop. The size is perfect for not needing too much storage space and it come with a strap so you can put it around your neck to capture your moments. 10/10 recommend.
## 13 A good basic DSLR camera, no argument. The kit gives you two lenses to use according to what you intend to shoot, at a price much less than if you were to buy those lenses separately. HOWEVER, once your pictures have been taken, the ability to transfer them to another device (smartphone or computer) is done wirelessly using wifi, and that is where the problem lies. I could never establish a consistent connection between the camera and my phone -- the software might work one time but not the next. Would have much preferred if there had been provided the appropriate cable for making such transfers. I've wasted so much time trying to get help from Youtube videos, without success, so I'm throwing in the towel and returning everything. Do yourself a favor and avoid the aggravation by choosing another option. /// UPDATE: Rather than return this camera I decided I would give the folks at Canon an opportunity to help (don't forget the Youtube videos necessarily, but maybe they weren't my best first choice). I was very pleasantly surprised by how well the support group at Canon helped me to understand how their camera-to-phone connection worked. First, there were NO long wait times to reach someone to talk to, both chat and phone personnel (LIVE, not bots, at least it seemed). They were friendly, patient, and caring. And knowledgeable! I am now able to easily transfer photos from my camera to my phone without any glitches. I did learn, however, that transferring videos is best done to a computer, as a computer will recognize Canon's video format while a phone may not. For that you'll need a mini USB cable (I advised Canon that it would be a sensible item to include with the camera kit, but it is conveniently available on Amazon). I can now confidently give this Canon camera kit a 4-star rating because I'm still getting familiar with its various modes of operation, otherwise I might have gone higher.

Though it does work I feel like I could have done better in that aspect. Now in every other way this thing is great. If you’re looking for an every day camera to just document or practice pretty much anything else but going into portraits for a profession, I really think this thing would be the one for you!

I initially came across it during a digital photography class where it was provided, and subsequently, I purchased it myself! It's incredibly easy to operate and handle, and now I use it as my primary tool for commercial photography. The results are exceptionally clear in well-lit areas. There can be some difficulties when shooting at night without flash, but the photos still turn out great after post-processing! The following photo was taken using the M mode, and it offers a great user experience.The battery life is also impressive. When I'm just taking photos and not recording videos, I can shoot for three to four hours straight without the battery level dropping significantly. However, video recording consumes more battery. Additionally, this camera is highly versatile, producing excellent results in portrait and landscape photography, and is also ideal for street photography.

The operation of the camera is easy after you read the instructions. The burst mode is my favorite. To take pictures of objects that are moving fast like hummingbirds the clarity of the wings. Wow! Video mode works at a great level. My son uses the camera for his photography class that is a requirement in High School. All school project to date are A grades. For the cost, it out preforms my Pentex 10mp camera that was bought years ago. If I would be asked! I would buy this camera again and again. I am completely satisfied with this product. Words I would use are: Great buy for the price. Perfect picture Clarity.

We couldn’t get a professional photographer, and I knew she would want good pictures. I’ve never had a real camera, and this one worked great! Simple to use for a beginner, loved that I could get the photos straight to my phone from the camera without having to plug into a laptop. The photos came out great, but I would recommend testing out the settings before using such as brightness, exposure etc. I love that you can adjust these things, and there is an auto adjust feature.

It is a great and easy to use camera that comes with a lot of tools for the camera such as a lens cap, charger, for the camera as well as a cloth to clean it. The camera itself is a little more on the side, but the money is worth it for the camera. It takes very high-quality pictures as well as videos and works great for my photography class and my needs for it. As someone who dabbles in photography but isn’t super heavily into it I would say this is a great starter camera as it also comes with directions on how to use it. One of the features that I really like is that an app connects the camera to your phone to directly download the pictures to your phone Via the camera Wi-Fi, (note the camera Wi-Fi is not actual Internet Wi-Fi and it’s only used to connect to your cellular device). It does also have a built-in flash into the camera to use at your disposal so you won’t need outside light sources as often. Dials also allow you to change the exposure to let in more light or let in less light, something that a device like your phone may not be able to do a bit more worth investing into.

The image above was captured in a cloudy and dull day when it was raining outsideThe camera itself has a very user-friendly interface. The speed and accuracy of focusing are great for its price, and good shots will come out quite easily even when there is motion involved. The battery life is also pretty good, which allows me to shoot for extended periods without the need to recharge as often.The touch screen is very simple and easy to navigate even for beginners, connectivity options are very wide, including Wi-Fi connection for seamless transfer of photos or videos to other devices.Generally speaking, this camera is pretty good especially for the low price whether you’re a beginner or pro and does not disappoint in performance. Would definitely Recommend.

It features a 64 MP resolution for sharp images, and 16x digital zoom. The simple design and user-friendly connection make it easy to use, it also has a reasonably sized screen that is great for framing and reviewing shots. However, the camera struggles in low-light places, and the digital zoom can reduce image quality. Even with these drawbacks, it offers good value for its price, making it a solid choice for those new to photography and other beginners. And the fact that it is already provided with a 32GB SD card is good. Overall a great camera.

Had cold shoe mount that is NOT Single-Contact Hotshoe. No way to use with Speedlite Camera Flash. The fake zoom lense is also confusing as people tried to adjust it while using the camera.

It's going to take some time to LEARN how to maximize it's potential due to it's many settings. I do wish it had an "anti-shake" feature but it don't. It does have a "manual focus" and an "auto focus" but it's really confusing on it's use and I need to LEARN it's settings to maximize it's potential. It says its "NOT" a professional quality and it is NOT so don't EXPECT it to do what it's not designed to do. Overall, I like it and I got exactly what I paid for so I'm good. Would I recommend it? Yes if you're looking for a decent entry level camera.

The camera is light and perfect kids in my opinion. It is also chock full of features like video activation and photo quality; ease of use is a breeze. I've been recommending this to all my friends with kids.AND it comes with the SD card and an extra battery, carrying case and lanyard. Can’t go wrong for the price. Definitely recommended!

It’s super light and comes with two fully charged batteries so it’s ready to use right out of the box. It has a convenient USB C port to connect to the computer. The quality is great and it’s nice to have photos on a device that can’t be hacked. I take my phone everywhere and risk losing it with my photos, so it’ll be nice to have memories saved on this camera as a backup.

The sturdy build withstands typical kid handling, while large buttons make it easy to use. Image quality is surprisingly good, capturing vibrant colors that excite him. Built-in filters add fun creativity. The simple interface and instant preview feature are perfect for his age. Battery life lasts all day, and the wrist strap prevents drops. The only downside is limited internal memory, easily solved with an SD card. Watching him explore photography with this age-appropriate, durable camera has been a joy. It's an excellent gift that encourages his creativity.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Of course, for such a low price, it should be great—it really is, along with sharp and of good quality, as only other cameras that are much more expensive deliver. The flip-out vlogging screen is, in fact, one of the most incredible features on this camera; that is what makes it really great for selfies, recordings, and on-the-go content creation.The camera is lightweight and very easy to use, which makes it perfect for a complete novice or anyone who wants hassle-free shots. However, the only downside is that the lens does not have an automatic cover, so dust can gather if you are not very careful. A quick wipe before use sorts the problem, but it is something to be aware of.All in all, this camera justifies an amazing value for its price tag, and I can definitely recommend it to anyone that needs something budget-friendly that’s worth using for photos or vlogging.

The camera looks identical to other’s reviews and the pictures online. This picture attached is a test shot I took to make sure that the camera was working.I think the best thing about this camera is that it is very straightforward and easy to use, with buttons and features that are self explanatory. I also like that the display can be flipped around for an easy selfie mode. Another feature I liked is that you can adjust the image quality on the camera itself, you can increase the pixels for a better picture or decrease it if you want. For the price, I really can’t complain. It doesn’t have the same advanced features as more premium cameras, but it’s great for anyone just getting into photography or looking for a backup camera.Overall, I’m very impressed with its performance, especially for the price. It offers a lot of features typically found in more expensive cameras, making it an excellent value for beginners or casual photographers. Highly recommended if you're on a budget but still want something reliable!

I needed a second camera for my YouTube videos and didn't want to spend a fortune. I just needed something affordable with good quality. The reviews on this camera were good so I gave it a shot. My expectations were vastly exceeded with the quality of the picture and the ease of use. The settings are easy to change and manage and it fits on any standard tripod. The flip-up screen is one of the best features when needing to see yourself in the camera frame.

The camera quality is about the same as my phone but with much better lighting, so it's not suuuper HQ but if you've been using a supbar phone to take pictures like I have for the past few years, this is definitely an upgrade. So my advice is, if quality is super important to you than I would look for another camera since this one is average. However, it is aesthetically pleasing and definitely gives off home video vibes. Only downsides are, 1. that the focusing is a little tricky to get a hang of, and if you get close to the camera it goes out of focus. 2., for selfie mode, you can't rotate the screen that's flipped it just stays in place, and 3., the camera falls forward when trying to balance it on a surface. You definitely need a tripod or something of the sort to keep the camera propped up. For the price it seems like a well made camera so far that won't break, and a very good replacement for my phone's limited storage.I will say, with this camera I literally took the best selfie ever! Very flattering, much more than my phone's lens

Easy to install and use.  Very bright.  Brightness can be controlled in the app along with motion sensitivity, motion zones, scheduling, etc.  The resolution is good but will be happy when they have 4k.

Setting it up was straightforward with clear instructions, and once installed, it instantly became a huge upgrade to my home security. The video quality is incredibly sharp, even at night, and I love that I can see and hear everything happening around my property. The 1080p HD camera captures clear footage during both day and night, and the night vision mode works surprisingly well.The two-way audio is a fantastic feature; it allows me to communicate with anyone at my door or on my property directly through my phone, which is great for deliveries or unexpected visitors. The motion detection is highly customizable, and I appreciate being able to adjust the sensitivity to avoid unnecessary alerts for small animals or passing cars. I especially love that it’s hardwired, so there’s no need to worry about charging batteries—just constant, reliable power.The floodlights are impressively bright and light up a wide area, deterring any potential intruders and giving me peace of mind when I come home after dark. I also like that they automatically turn on when motion is detected, which is both energy-efficient and convenient.

Took me about 20 minutes to climb the ladder, remove the old light, and install the Ring unit.  After I returned power, camera starting to talking to me through the speaker.  After scanning the QR code on the documentation with my Ring "App", went through set-up in about 3 minutes automatically and was working.  Camera is clear, with a wide viewing angle, and very good microphone and speaker.

Not too hard to install. Good video, wide angle. Bright lights. Worth it.

It’s straightforward to mount and install. It works well, good camera quality, good motion detection and the light is very bright. My one con is the plug design that blocks the other outlet I have when plugged in. Lot of customizable camera capture and recording options from the ring app. I definitely recommend this floodlight cam, either the plug-in or hardwired version over the battery, whether you’re a current ring user or new to ring.

The setup was easy and it updated the firmware right off the bat.  The camera was added automatically to my subscription after 30 days.  Great buy.

This is perfect because I like that it is actually a high quality camera that takes really nice pictures!! I am able to hook it up to the computer and download all pics easily and the manual is really easy to understand. The camera comes with a cheap bag so I’ll be getting her a more protective cover but other than that everything else was included. Extra lithium battery, lens cap, 32GB memory stick and chargers for everything as well. The camera is also lightweight which is perfect for her to operate. So excited for her and I to both be able to have high quality pics at such an affordable cost!! The camera feels durable and like it should last her for years.

I love how easy it is to switch settings and snap photos, as well as flip the screen around to take selfies/videos! The zoom feature is so nice and the video quality is awesome as well!

Easy to use and transfer pictures around. I really like the autofocus. It's fast and accurate. The 16X digital zoom is a nice addition, enabling me to get closer to the action without sacrificing image quality.The 3.0-inch flip screen is a fantastic addition as it allows me to frame shots or vlog on YouTube while having real-time control over the frame. The camera is compact and fits comfortably in my hand.The package also includes a 32GB SD card, two batteries and a charger.This camera is very beginner friendly, Highly recommend!

We downloaded the photos to our home computer, and the picture quality is perfect.It comes with 32gb card and 2 batteries. No charging issues for now.This is great because when you run out of one, you can use the other.These batteries can last for a long time.Overall, It is worthy of five-star recommendation.

It is really a good camera for the beginner. It totally looks profesional but the software is very beginner friendly. The accessories of the camera are very complete, and the user manual is also available. We got it for a special event, outdoors during night time and the quality is definitely better that a phone. It also comes with a free SD card so you don't have to worry about storage.Its very practical to start learning about photography and vlogging.  I highly recommend getting it.

Large screen, easy to operate, works fast, good sound. Way better than more expensive android phones I owned in the past. Very happy with the purchase.

However, two things stood out as particularly annoying. First, when you swipe up to close a window, a screenshot button appears and often gets accidentally tapped, resulting in a bunch of unwanted screenshots in your album. Second, the picture quality is quite poor, though that's expected at this price point. Ultimately, we decided to return this phone for another option.

Front/back facing cameras, face unlock, fingerprint unlock and video recording capability. I bought it to be able to use just one Android app that was not available on iOS. So far it had worked great.Don't expect it to run any 3D games or application smoothly, but for general use, you can't beat the price. It runs on Android 14.

Last one lasted well until dropped right on screen after a gym visit.1. Excellant battery life, often go more than two days without needing a charge. Big plus2. I'm not a gamer, but I do surf and watch U tube a lot. Screen is good, has excellant brightness, but contrast is not as good as with high end screens (totally expected) but I'll keep my cash instead3. Camera is good, really nice color reproduction and good details. Not as clear as my daughter in laws I Phone, but I saved a LOT of money.4. Storage capacity is excellant with the ability to add a compact memory card.  Big plus in my book, these are pretty cheap actually. Amazon Basics microSDXC 128 GB for 12 bucks.  I run a 300GB size because I love videos.

Plus when phone is done you can reused it.5. Size is perfect for fitting into shirt pocket for me at work, even with a case on it.6. Sound is actually decent, but does not emulate hi fi. I realize the phone environment is a huge challenge, but the sound, even with music is not "Tinny". Volume is good on highest setting and can easily be heard when sitting on my desk across the room. I've heard phone get a lot louder, but if I want a ghetto blaster I do have some speakers for outdoors and the like usage.7. I'd say you get about 80% of the usage and quality of "Flagship" phones with virtually all the functionality at a cost that's about 25-30% of flagship prices. I've had phones fly away riding my motorcycle (Use a GOOD mount lol), dropped, knocked off while working on car and a lot of other usage cycles that are not amenable to good phone life.  For me it doesn't pay to buy top of the line. But I do like having a solid tool to do the job, and this one works great for that.  Stay safe.

It's powerful, functional and has good all around connectivity. Battery life, sound and camera quality are pretty good. Friendly user interface also.My only criticism is that it doesn't come with a charger.Overall it's a very good bargain for it's price.

I've had mixed results with the G Power phones (2020, 2023 and 2024) and while this isn't the phone I fell in love with in 2020, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the 2023 version that made me abandon the brand entirely.Pros:- It'll run most anything fine.- Minimal bloatware on the phone.- Love having a SD Card expansion back to expand the amount of hard drive space on my phone- I like the faux leather back finish on the phone, feels better than the plastic back of most phones and is good if you have issues with phones slipping out of your hands.Cons:- Brightness is all over the place.  It feels like 91% is retina burning and 90% is too dim. Not sure how to get a better balance.- Battery won't come close to what they're claiming; I'm not a power user (1-3 hours a day gaming), but the battery just bleeds life. Can have a full charge at 7 AM and by 4 PM it's hanging around somewhere between 40-50%.Overall, I'm happy to see that this wasn't total junk like the previous year installment of the series was.

I didn't think I would like it as much because my last phone was a Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra, but a lot of features between the phones are actually really similar. It's very fas and responsive, super customizable, and has endless features.

I'll admit, I was skeptical at first, but when I bought this it changed my mind. I had a Samsung Galaxy a10 previously, and it kind of sucked. This phone fixed all the issues I had with my old one.  The camera quality is nicer, it has more storage (55 GB), it can run/load any app a lot faster, the battery is AMAZING (I lost 20% in an entire day (however I'm not as active as other people with their phones so take that in mind)), and has a lot of nifty features that you only realize when you actually have the phone. It alerts you when it reaches your normal bedtime, the brightness changes automatically to fit your schedule, it has fingerprint unlock, and you can customize the phone any way you want. The company could've charged any price they wanted, and I'm glad they didn't. This is an amazing phone when it is your first one or when you're upgrading from a trashy one, and the price gives you a lot of bang for your buck.

I will be using this as a back up phone.The pluses.Nice big clear and bright screen.I like the case and the color. It looks and feel quite decent,Good, responsive touchscreen with good colors.Good wifi and bluetooth. On screen keyboard is also easy to use.Large battery, I charged it to 100 % last night and its still at 70%Good sound quality and fairly loud speakers.Negatives.There is some lag but that is in comparison to my “high end” main phone but I consider it to be more than acceptable.The cameras have great colors are appear to be over processed.If this was for use as my main shooter, it  would not be acceptable but for the bargain price, and considering that this is  budget phone, both front and rear cameras will suffice.Not too keen on the side finger print reader, it does work and actually responds quite fast, I don’t care for the location.So as a budget back up phone, there are some negatives but I can live with them all.Not; the first two photos were taken with the rear came at high resolution. The third was taken with the front facing camera. The last two were taken indoors in a restaurant setting on high resolution.I quite like this phone. I had been considering a 5 year old phone for a back up…. It still had really good specs but I was concerned about the battery and how much longer it would work. Also there would not be any security updates on an older phone but this is from 2024 and has already done several updates since I first powered it on, and it is due to be upgraded to Android 14 later this summer. ( I mention this because there are surely other folks looking for a budget back up phone.)Also, since I don’t play any games, I cant offer any opinions in that respect.For a back up phone, its ideal and I recommend it!
## 19 How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL  ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are "system apps" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, "just uninstall them and move on!" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no "delete" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like "com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000" and "<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . .

The screen is noticeably better quality; with better color, and brighter, and its 120Hz refresh provides smooth video. The screen tech is the same as the top-tier iPhone & Samsung models. I also like a stylus because it helps with editing which I cannot do with a fingertip.There are several configurations of this device depending on where it is purchased. This particular one is "Unlocked" in its TOP trim. The rest of its specs are impressive considering its current price point.

I am someone who despises the sound of Bluetooth for music so I knew I wanted to find something modern with a stylus and a headphone jack, since I also despise carrying an extra adapter around and want to be able to enjoy my music while the phone is charging without being forced to use Bluetooth. I didn't necessarily need or want a flagship when I went shopping for this phone, just wanted something mid range which supported the latest 5g, Wifi, and Bluetooth standards, and for a mid range phone, the Moto G Stylus 2023 doesn't disappoint.First a couple of potential negatives for some people: I knew I liked the stylus, but never used the remote function so the Moto G only having a basic stylus without the remote camera function of the Galaxies wasn't an issue with me, but, may be for some users who like the more advanced styluses such as the ones that the Galaxy Notes have. The only other negative I have noticed is that while the 50MP camera is great in bright light, it isn't quite as good as some others in low light, but it's far from the worst I have encountered in a modern phone.That being said, now that I have the potential negatives out of the way, I absolutely love everything else about this phone.It's comfortable to hold.The display is clear and crisp and I have no issues using it in any light level from bright daylight to a very dark room. The display is also great for watching movies and videos, and I had no issues doing some light gaming on it either.The battery lasts roughly 2 days with my relatively heavy use.Both cell and Wifi reception are excellent. I work in some very isolated rural areas  in the Rocky Mountains and this phone works in places where my co worker's brand new iPhone doesn't on the same carrier (Verizon in this case). No dropped calls or lack of 4g/5g service in many spots where his iPhone is useless.The 256 G of on board memory plus the ability to add 2TB more on a Micro SD card is another plus for this phone, my purchase price for it and a 1 TB micro SD card was a fraction of most flagship phones cost, some of which, including every iPhone ever made, don't even offer the option to add storage.Besides for support for additional memory, if you still like listening to music through a standard headphone jack, this phone doesn't disappoint. The sound is very good though the jack, and the onboard DAC and headphone amp seem to have a great frequency response and an extremely low noise floor and no evidence of RF noise or other annoying interference. Another unadvertised, yet pleasant surprise, which some people may be interested in, was finding that this phone has an FM radio tuner on board, a rarity for a US market phone these days. I tried it out and it performed surprisingly well, great sensitivity for pulling in distant stations and great selectivity which allows for pleasant listening when 2 stations are right next to each other on the dial. It even supports RDS which displays artist name and song titles, among other things, for stations which transmit that data.Overall, a very impressive product for the price, great job Motorola!Highly recommend this phone!

The processor is snappy and as long you stick with normal day-to-day activities it and the RAM is more than sufficient. I wouldn’t buy this if you’re a gamer but almost everything else works great. Battery life? Outstanding. Upgrading from a Moto G Power 2020 the plastic back is annoying. I get people don’t like to see fingerprints but the shiny G Power back had a stick to it making it easier to hold. The back on this phone is very slippery and annoying to hold. But a thin silicone case solved that problem. For someone looking for a perfectly capable phone but doesn’t want to pay insane flagship prices I think you’ll like this one.

For the value you get on this type of budget, it's a great performer and does everything well!  Only thing I'm missing is the wireless charging, but I'll acquire that in my next phone perhaps.  The display is decent, speakers are loud, bluetooth works well including in my vehicle, NFC is always welcome for convenience.  Screen protectors are easy to acquire and install since the screen's flat, and cases are great for this phone.

I looked at a lot of reviews before pulling the trigger and I shopped a few brands.1st - 4 Android upgrades (1/yr) and 5 years of security patches CAN'T BE BEAT at this price point.2nd - IP67 dust/water resistant (up to 1m for 30 min).Great screen (Super AMOLED, 120Hz, 1000 nits) and the adaptive brightness works super well (High Brightness Mode). Solid build with Victus Glass front and rear on a plastic frame. 5000 mAh battery and 25W charging give longevity and fast top ups. The 5nm Exynos 1380 chipset has 4x2.4 GHz & 4x2.0 GHz processors along with 6GB RAM, 128GB internal storage and micro SDXC slot. Plenty of power and storage under the hood for all except maybe the hardcore power users and game junkies. A fantastic all-around phone for most users. Fingerprint reader under the screen works great providing accurate and fast access to the device. Stereo speakers have plenty of volume and a pleasing tone for streaming videos. Audiophiles will want quality ear buds regardless of the speakers. The sound is well tuned for normal use. Calls are clear and trouble free.I don't really do selfies; the front camera is 13MP of acceptable. Not horrible, not wow.Let's talk triple rear cameras. 50 MP, f/1.8, (wide) with PDAF (phase detection auto focus) and OIS (optical image stabilization - way better then electronic image stabilization) + 8 MP, f/2.2 (ultrawide) + 5 MP, f/2.4, (macro). Like their displays, Samsung also makes their own camera sensors and know what they are about in both departments. In my experience, the biggest limiter on phone cameras is the controlling software. Here Samsung gives you acceptable level software. No brand name glass (like Zeiss or Leica) for the lenses. The cameras are solidly utilitarian and get the job done with enough power to give you some creative wiggle room. Those who know how can tweak their pictures by learning the strengths and weaknesses and going to post processing when needed. Unfortunately, there is no RAW support, or you could make even better progress in post. There are also several shooting modes that users might utilize to adapt to the composition of a particular image capture.The main camera operates in a 12.5MP mode by default. I went into settings > settings to keep > camera mode (switch on) so that it remembers I want the 50MP mode and saves it when I open the camera app again. There is no zoom in 50MP mode, but I'd rather crop in on more pixels than use less pixels getting degraded by digital zoom in most use case scenarios.The picture of the steering wheel detail was taken with the 5MP f/2.4 macro lens, auto settings, no post process.The two cloudscapes were captured with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, no post process. You only achieve 50MP when shooting in full aspect ratio. I prefer 16:9 so those images are 37.5MP.The picture of the moon was taken in Pro mode (12.5MP) with 10x zoom, ISO 40 and -2.0ev.The picture of the $1 coin was captured with the main camera at 50MP. I used a 10x macro lens clipped in front of the main camera and did post processing in Snapseed.The picture of the moth was captured with the main camera at 12.5MP and 2x zoom. Post processed in Snapseed.All-in-all: solid value for money and a phone you likely won't upgrade from anytime soon. It has all you need to make it a faithful companion for years.Quick Update: I was out taking Milkyway photos the other night with my mirrorless camera. I did add one image to this review, taken with the A35. The photo of the trees after sunset was during the Blue Hour (low light) with the main camera in 50MP mode, auto settings, lightly edited in Snapseed. The capture was at 1/9th of a second and demonstrates the effectiveness of the Optical Image Stabilization.I was also using the Stellarium app with live view and can attest to the accuracy and responsiveness of the compass sensor on the Galaxy A35. I just keep finding more reasons to love this phone!

I have been using the Motorola Moto g mid range phones for the past five years and decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy over the Moto g Stylus 5G 2024.  I am very pleased with my decision.  The Samsung was slightly more money, but it was worth it,  it offers four years of Android O.S, upgrades compared to only one with the Motorola Moto g series phones,The A35 was very easy to set-up by connecting it to my Samsung Galaxy tablet.  It quickly transferred all of the settings and apps from the tablet.  My first impression of the phone is that it has a brilliant AMOLED display.  It is fast and easy to use, has a better camera system than my previous phone and feels comfortable to hold.  The 5,000 mAh battery charges super fast at 25 watts and lasts a full day.In summary, I am very pleased with my Samsung Galaxy A35 5G smartphone and would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a reliable mid-range phone.

Yes i know they say its safe non-ionizing radiation... blah blah.. they said smoking and lead paint were ok too. I use my phone A lot.. tell it to the next guy buddy lol.  5) Price was reasonable enough. Anyway, the phone has been generally amazing so far, much faster and smoother than my old one.  Beautiful screen, although every once in a while some text has a barely noticeable very slight flicker on certain apps/ scripts? I shut off adaptive display something or other, which helped, but again barely noticeable and almost never happens.  Generally amazing, very fast, vibrant, and smooth thanks to the quality display and fast refresh rate.  I used a usb-c flash drive along with Samsung's "Smart switch" app to backup my old phone (motorola) then transfer onto the A35.  Esim setup was a breeze on US mobile's warp (verizon) network - so long as you have *this model* of the A35, which is the US Version (The US Version is A356u, NOT the cheaper latin american/ international A356E.. and probably also the international A55 could have compatibility issues too.. I dont know - I believe the a55 is only available in an international version - Samsung wants you to buy thd s23 fe instead.. The US unlocked models will have the best compatibility with your carrier if u live in the US - yes they are more expensive... anyway I digress)  So far this phone has been generally great.  I have purchased another one to have two lines on the A35.

The A15 4G international version definitely works on the Bell network in Canada, and the total cost to get it shipped to my door was around $280 CAD for a phone a little over $160 USD. The phone arrive in perfect condition WITH a phone charger within a few days. I am lifelong Motorola user for my personal phone and have a newish S23 for work. At the USD price of this phone, the A15 4G really does blow away competitor 4G phones at this price range, but I was a bit nervous about leaving my 100% reliable, but super clunky Moto behind.There are a lot of excellent online reviews for the A15 4G/5G, but some of highlights of this international version include full 1080 HD OLED display (which is great), 6 GB of ram (most are 4 GB at this $ range), NFC for financial transactions (less common in sub $200 phones), and the promised extended  support for Android updates / security patches. The 4G is also dual sim, but you have to make a choice with the second slot - either a second sim card OR an SD card for more memory.  Whatever version of the A15 4G/5G phone you purchase, read the phones specs carefully. There are a lot of common features between the various versions of these phones, but differences appear to occur. For instance, the 5G A15 is single sim and Samsung states NFC is region specific. The official version of this phone in Canada only has 4GB of ram at this time.So far this phone has worked extremely well, and it is a user experience that approximates my work S23. You are not going to get a great game experience, world shattering photos or film your YouTube  content with this phone, but it is great for standard phone activities. This is a low end Samsung phone, so that requires a little caution. This phone could well have some unidentified issue that will impact all users (e.g. battery probs. or random rebooting etc.) However, off the starting line, this phone appears to be excellent value.

I can tell you that it's doing everything $500 phone does. In at a fraction of the cost. Good value overall. Camera is good. The processing speed for apps was a big Focus for me. Avoiding slow down and having plenty of internal storage was my main goals. Not deleting any apps for internal space is truly a blessing. Good battery.

It arrived in a day and came with charger cord and box. However when I registered it with my cell carrier i was told it was going to have slower speeds. When I’m not connected to WiFi I literally have NO SERVICE. it’s not 4g or 5g. If I’m out in a slow or poor service area it’s just a pretty paper weight. I guess I’m gonna have to get another one but make sure it’s 5g.

The screen is good for making my eyes comfortable to see.2. I like the design, it is simple and the weight is low3. the camera is good base the price.4. Google Play, YouTube, and other apps work well after a VPN.5. Battery work long (1-2 days)Bad:1. Charging speed to slow, it takes about 2 hours to go to 100%2. The system could be faster. but based on the price, it is acceptable.3. The APP Line can't work here, but it is not the phone's cause.4.

Calidad vs precio está increíble. Llegó en muy buenas condiciones nuevo en su caja con todos los sellos de seguridad. Funciona muy bien y en mi caso le puse un sim telcel y no batallé nada para configurarlo. Viene con un sim gratis marca Telmovil me parece que es muy buena opción solo que ya había comprado el de Telcel. En la caja del celular viene manual, garantía, herramienta para poner el sim y la tarjeta micro SD y un cable que sería para cargar pero ambas entradas son tipo C así que no entra al cargador porque ese tiene entrada USB pero creo que se compra un adaptador y listo. Yo tenía un cargador con la misma entrada así que no batallé. La entrega fue súper rápida llegó de un día para otro. En general es muy buen celular.

O sea que si una persona ha tenido pocos celular antes, o no usa funciones intensas, logrará un gran provecho.Está liberado, por lo que puede usar SIM de cualquier compañía (MX).He viajado al extranjero y basta con comprar un SIM y ponerlo en el celular, y funcionará sin problemas.
