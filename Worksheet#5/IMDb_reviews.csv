The series is visually stunning in 3D and 2D animation with beautiful attention to detail. There is incredible world building, an engaging story line, music that serves as narration and a stellar voice cast. I give this series a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Steampunk Fantasy Adventure}"

And, now having seen the whole first season, my rating remains even more solidly a 10! :-)Groundbreaking/beautiful animation, awesome environments, spectacular cinematography, cool musical choice, compelling characters, great voice casting/acting, and some interesting Sci-Fi/Fantasy lore! :-)YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS SHOW!!! :-)"
"3",NA,"Tactrix","Nov 6, 2021",10,"This is ART!",NA,"Beautiful storytelling, great underline currents, and the emotion behind this is just amazing. The story is for everyone, but especially for League of Legends fans. The entire time I was watching it I was trying to piece together who is whom. And some of them are obvious but other ones really make you dig deep and see where they're trying to head.I truly believe this is a fantastic series, I love everything I've seen of it so far. 10/10 a complete knockout."

When i first turned this on and saw kids i immediately turned it off and sighed ""not another kids show"". But then i kept watching and realized this is not a kids show. It just has kids as characters. But wow it got dark and good."
"5",NA,"djurrepower","Nov 6, 2021",9,"Excellent, also for non league fans",NA,"I watched it with my parents who don't know anything about league's universe. I have been playing league since 2010, So my opinion may be a bit biased.But my parents were pleasantly surprised. They said that sometimes it was a little clear that this series is more aimed at a young adult audience. Some usage of the pop songs, and the villian being a little over the top mustace twirly.But overall they enjoyed the first 3 episodes and wouldn't mind watching the rest in their own time.As for me. I loved it! It was everything I hoped for and then some. Riot's art department was always on their A game. And with the track record from Fortiche I knew this had very little chance to blunder.Knowing Riot's art department it has an excellent story, well written charaters and a lore rich world to take elements from. All in all, this show comes together very nicely. And shows some of the best talents Riot has to offer.9/10: Amazing."

In the cities of Piltover and Zaun there is unrest, Piltover the upper city literally looks down on and oppresses Zaun. We have gangs of thieves, rebels, steampunk Stormtroopers, magic melded with science. This is serious stuff with great physical and ""magic"" fights. Also a tale of two sisters falling out and Scientist/Mages battling against the conservatism of the Council who fear the unleashing of uncontrollable powers. It's set in the League Of Legends game universe. Directed by Pascal Charrue and Arnaud Delord, written by Christian Linke and Alex Yee. 9/10."
"7",NA,"Harun_Karali","Nov 19, 2021",10,"Brilliant Writing is Pushed to the Stratosphere by Masterful Visuals",NA,"As someone who had never played the game before, this was a great introduction to its lore. The story was riveting and the pacing was perfect. And the amazing animation and soundtrack just enhanced the entire viewing experience. The VAs did an incredible job as well, particular the VA for Powder/Jinx."
"8",NA,"jasminn_tan","Nov 20, 2021",10,"Wow!",NA,"I'm not a League of Legends player. In fact, I know almost nothing about it. But this show is fantastic. To say that the opening scenes of the first episode were ""gripping"" is an understatement. I don't often start on the edge of my seat with a TV show-- animated or live action.(UPDATE 1/14/2022: Rewatching the show for the second time and the opening scene still puts me at the edge of my seat, holding my breath. Wow.)The animation is well above average for a TV series. It's atmospheric in ways that most animated series don't even try. This isn't just another Star Wars-style animated series. It feels distinctly unique.The characters are also really interesting. Again, I know nothing about League of Legends. But based on the series description, I'm assuming at least a couple of these characters become a league champion? Ultimately, I have no idea what that really means. But I'm interested in finding out.And that's why I think this series is really successful. I don't know anything about the source material, but after just the opening scenes of the first episode, I'm invested in finding out more.10/10 easily. I would give it that score just for the first few minutes of the series alone."
"9",NA,"jhuebel","Nov 6, 2021",10,"Not A League of Legends Player, This is FANTASTIC",NA,"Arcane tells the story of two young orphaned sisters, growing up and getting into trouble in the dual city of Zaun and Piltover.The series is based on the video game League of Legends, and although it drops you right into this fictional world, the necessary time and care is taken to set up places and characters in a commendable show-don't-tell fashion. Solid character development and world building means it's an entirely enjoyable watch without knowing anything about the game.The animation is outright exquisite. As an anime fan, I found the animation in Arcane to be leagues beyond anything I've ever seen from an animated series before. There is an incredible attention to detail. It's clear that no artistic talent or monetary expense was spared in bringing the world of Runeterra to life.Great soundtrack, great acting and a compelling story that doesn't pull any punches when it comes to violence and more adult themes.So far only the first three episodes have been released, and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us!"
"10",NA,"Tweekums","Dec 24, 2021",10,"An animated sci-fi epic",NA,"Arcane (2021)I have never played a single minute of League of Legends in my life but I always knew how influential this online game is. Normally, I wouldn't have paid attention to this series but considering the 9.4 on IMdB, I had to check out at least an episode to see what is so incredible about it. Starting of in a rather casual way, I wasn't too impressed with what I saw in that first episode, but the cliffhanger made me want to see what would happen next. Once I climbed that cliff, I was immersed into a fast paced steampunk world that had a lot to offer and many more cliffhangers to be experienced.The animation style of this series is best described as taking 6 buckets of paint, throwing them into a 10,000 volt transformer and stepping into the electrical blend of colors to be engulfed in the sheer awesomeness. As you adjust to this dynamic animation, you wilk see a story of an inventor, an underworld crime boss and a girl who wants to find her sister. All of these characters find themselves in the middle of a political intrigue that involves a utopian city and a rotten underbelly with it's social classes striving to achieve their goals by any means necessary. To top it off, there is plenty of emotional stuggle between family, friends and enemies.While all the technical, sound and visual aspects are second to none, it is the characters that made me want to come back to this series again and again. The show is irresistible to watch and the two reasons for that are the masterfully crafted intro that got me pumped in the beginning of each episode and the nail-biting cliffhangers that made me want to see hiw the story continues. Whether you like videogames or not, this show will grab your interest and won't let up until the final second. At that point, you will be anxiously waiting for season 2 which I hope will come very soon.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Show reviews."
"11",NA,"JohnGrizis","Nov 27, 2024",7,"Arcane",NA,"Here's to the new us.League of Legends (LoL)' first project in expanding its own cinematic universe is done. The story between sisters, rich and poor, loyalty and betrayal, peace and war, and everything in between.There's a common saying that LoL's big budget went into animation instead of balancing the champions in game, and this couldn't be more right. I did not expect this masterful level of animation. After each episode, they found more ways to wow audiences with amazing visuals and transitions. The fighting scenes were hard-hitting and jaw-dropping.Even though the series wasn't fully canon to the original lore, it's still an intense story that set up an interesting universe. Not gonna lie, the first act didn't impress me too much, but episode 4 afterward got me entirely on board. My only problem with the story was that I just couldn't get enough of it. I wanted more and I don't like waiting.Just as cool as the animation was the characters. Many character dynamics fascinated me and made me realized how much I needed them. I'll admit that some characters were straightforward, but not all of them were predictable. Some still surprised me until the very end. The directions for all characters were incredible.Overall, even though the game was a love-hate relationship, Arcane was for sure all love, and a phenomenal step in setting up LOLCU. 8.5/10."
"12",NA,"genericimdbusername1111","Nov 25, 2024",5,"Fumbled the landing",NA,"I never played the game lots of people at my jobs are fan of it.But this series is amazing, anime, story everything i can't wait to see season 2 and where it goes."
"13",NA,"svederen","Nov 6, 2021",9,"Not just for fans of the video game",NA,"This review is for the first 3 Episodes which were released on Netflix on the 7th November.The story is set on the street of Zaun about Powder/Jinx & Vi who are criminals. The story is very interesting and the OST just amazing. The Animations is not your everyday CGI animation. Looks more hand drawn. After watching Episode 1 it keeps you wanting to watch more based on character development and story. It is a little bit predictable if you know the characters from the game and the lore behind them.If you are new to the League of Legends Universe, this show does help you understand each character what they are trying to achieve.I give this a 9 out of 10, not only because I'm a League of Legends fan but mainly based on Story, Characters & Music.Highly Recommended."
"14",NA,"arabnikita","Nov 26, 2021",10,"Impossible to stop",NA,"What I especially enjoyed was how expressive the characters are. Character development is impressive for every single major character. Many of the characters are morally grey in a realistic way. Most shows are lucky to get a few characters that go through good character development arcs- in Arcane we get to see all the main characters develop and it's never forced or unrealistic. Overall, Arcane is a masterclass in world-building and character writing. This puts most other television shows to shame in the intensity and detail of its story, and will be remembered as a staple in the development and adaptation of modern fantasy for years to come. I'm really looking forward to season 2."

I hope they make another season."

"21",NA,"jamesaedwards-22729","Feb 10, 2024",10,"Everyone needs to not take things so seriously",NA,"Rick and Morty is equally one of the most influential pieces of entertainment in the 2010's decade while also creating one of the most insufferable fan bases out of any media in that time, as well.The premise for the show is one of the most distilled versions of Postmodern ideology that you really can find - there's no real point to anything, objectivity goes right out the window, so might as well do whatever you want while you can.At its best, this show goes off the rails with (not so subtle) references to other pieces of culture that mixes a push to make fun of the very things that they're referencing. At its worst, it's patronizing and self-referential in a way that's been the catalyst to create some of the egotistical fanbases that it now has.However, for all that's been said about this show (the good and the bad), that's precisely what has driven its ethos for 7 seasons (and more) - ""we can make fun of whatever we want to and do whatever we want to because what you love doesn't actually matter. You and I are both going to die one day.""I love this show for many reasons. Top of the list being - what they make fun of, I also understand and love as well. From Ice T, to Birdperson, to the council of the Rick's, and the commercial for Two Brothers, this show has no problem letting its imagination drive the engine in fresh, new ways while being wholly unoriginal most of the time (and better for it)."
"22",NA,"tabraham44","Jan 21, 2014",10,"Easily the best show I've seen in a while",NA,"This show is honestly great. It is easily the best animation show I have seen in a while on any network. The second the show starts you can tell that the characters fit perfectly with each other, and involved with the craziness that happens in the universe with Rick and Morty, they are immediately hilarious and extremely creative at the same time. A couple episodes in and I could tell that this was a unique show, and that people need to be watching it because it has huge potential. And with Dan Harmon writing and directing at the helm of it all, the magic that this show brings is a rare gem in television that people need to watch.. So yeah I highly suggest this show to anyone who wants a true genuine laugh at least once a week."
"23",NA,"Supermanfan-13","Mar 11, 2024",8,"Glad I finally started watching this",NA,"This is an extremely solid show. It is *dark*, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format.The ending of ""Rick Potion #9"" is just amazing. Likewise, the end of ""M. Night Shaym Aliens"".The strength of the show is just how amoral Rick may be; but there is a strong attachment to the ""many universes"" hypothesis within the show. Philosophers have long debated the moral implications of ""many universes"" ( while realizing it's a bit sophomoric and nerdy ) ; ""Rick and Morty"" picks at this as its stock in trade. Morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well.The essential dyad at the center - the title characters - interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in B plots. This shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. There's a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. The interaction between Rick and Morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist; a heck of a trick. It must be hard to calibrate this.The entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. Pacing is always even and feels right. The writers know where to push and where not to.We will see how long this can be maintained. The writers show a gift for twisting & adding-to old plots into new shows. Hopefully that's a stable arrangement.As an ""agent of Chaos"", Rick should serve us for many years. There are actual ideas underneath all the humor, and here's to them. This might well be the best thing on television right now."
"24",NA,"lcargill99","Jan 31, 2014",10,"Very solidly constructed television.",NA,"I've heard nothing but great things about Rick and Morty but still put off watching it for so long, I finally started it and boy am I glad I finally did. It's hilarious and original! My favorite animated series are Family Guy, Archer, Bojack Horsemen, shows like that and this is right there with them. It's definitely weird but in a good way, a way that will keep you laughing at every episode. You really become invested in it's world and characters like it's a thrilling drama, not an adult animated comedy. Each episode is funny, smart and weird. It's exactly what a science fiction comedy should be. Don't be like me and keep putting off...watch it, it really is as good as everyone says it is!"
"25",NA,"Rob1331","Jan 17, 2023",8,"Pretty Funny!",NA,"Send help! I rewatched this 5 times already and it's still amazing, and I never rewatch anything."
"26",NA,"sophiamar","May 1, 2019",10,"WE NEED MORE EPISODES!!!",NA,"Rick and Morty is a hilarious new show by the genius behind Community seasons 1-3 and 5, Dan Harmon. The episodes so far have always seemed fresh and the writing is hilarious and creative. But then there's no surprise really since its co-creator created Community.The hilarious mixture of wittiness, slapstick and action all add to making this show one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.From what I've seen so far, the show easily parodies different movies and topics, also slyly sneaking in references (sometimes not slyly).The art also is simple, but very appealing. Because the show is animated, Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland and the writers have been able to break free from the chains of live action, making the show more out of this world.I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially fans of the Regular Show, Adventure Time and Community."
"27",NA,"theong32","Dec 23, 2013",10,"A genius mix of emotion, comedy and sci-fi!",NA,"There's not just one thing I love about this show, everything that goes into the show, how the creators treat their fans, to the characters created, to the writing, everything what makes this what it is I love."

Rick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it."
"29",NA,"wifebanger","May 30, 2019",10,"😍😍",NA,"Heads Up: This review is based on the first few episodes of Season 1 only. I was really looking forward to Rick and Morty based on the hilarious teaser and the fact that this is a hand drawn show like older, more classic cartoons. My concern was that it would end up with a weak, poorly written script. That is not the case whatsoever. This show is incredibly original with its writing, characters, style and imagination. Every episode AND joke is completely different from the last, which keeps this show fresh and exciting to watch. While I think Rick (the grandpa) is the funniest, No character is bad. Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good. The only problem I have with the show, is that I don't really think they know how to end each episode (so far at least). But, this is truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to comedy, and I think adultswim has a really good show on their hands... 9/10"
"30",NA,"realjakeobrien","Dec 10, 2013",9,"Original and Hand Drawn.",NA,"To me, Rick and Morty absolutely wasn't love at first sight. The concept instinctively didn't make sense to me, at first. A grandpa and his grandson. What I loved from the start was the adventurous alternate universes, and the potential in my imagination. This show could go anywhere. What really stuck was a couple of alternate universes that really touched my heart. I didn't expect that. And I would have settled for less. The jokes by themselves are hilarious, already. All main characters have proper personalities, unseen to date. The show didn't go for 'smooth.' Maybe, you have to go for something else to achieve 'smooth.' You can't aim for smooth, but that's the only thing, I can think of, that falls short of a 10. A ""Captain-America-smooth."" Maybe the last thing that's missing is a shield ? Naw. But all those adventures need to start standing for something. Even if Grandpa Rick is just chasing that kind of over-arching ... thing."
"31",NA,"makiefer-87128","Mar 6, 2024",9,"Love it",NA,"Sad to see such a great show die, but no king rules forever (my son). 4 bad episodes in a row now. They feel so unnatural, forced. It's like the writers changed completely, not the voice actor. If I didn't know Roiland was swapped for somebody else I woudn't have noticed by just voices alone. But voices aside, the writing is irredeemable. A show that had such great episodes in the earlier seasons that it had infinite rewatchability, has come to this.Other episodes of the season were bad as well, with varying degrees. But the last one (s07e04) had no funny moment. At all. Simply no witty dialogue. No cool story. Instead of absurd scenes, where the whole setting is funny to begin with, it's just shock value.In the earlier seasons it was maybe 1 (one) bad episode per season. Right now we are looking at 1 (one) GOOD episode per season, optimistically. It is well and truly over.Despite a few cringe episodes in the earlier seasons, that I wrote off as nonexistant in my headcanon , this was at one point my favourite TV show. Now turned mediocre. At this point I'd rather just watch Family Guy and South Park. Despite both shows being past their prime, at least there is some ""in your face"" humor to be found there. All that's left in Rick and Morty is a lame, unfunny regurgitation of the things we've seen or a subpar social commentary.""Morty, I discovered suicide. It's when you die by killing yourself, Morty. And we're gonna make it an episode. Season 9 more seasons of Rick and Morty for 97 more years""
10 for the first few season and 1 for the latest instalments, with average rounded down to 5 . Adios."
"32",NA,"matsuda-ets","Nov 7, 2023",5,"Goodnight sweet prince",NA,"Let me just say that I was very skeptical about this show. Judging from the sneak peaks and previews, I assumed this was going to be just another family guy/ Brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. Well gee wizz, I was very very wrong! Rick and Morty might seem like some stupid knock off of Back to the Future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable TV, but its not. Behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you won't really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer.The weakest aspect is the animation. Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon. Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. They aren't just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. In fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot.What I'm trying to say is that this show is near perfect. What are you still doing watching new Simpsons and Family guy, go watch this show if you haven't already. Its a great example of how TV hasn't turned to total crap."
"33",NA,"sweetcommando","Mar 25, 2014",8,"Just as TV started to go downhill...",NA,"I absolutely love this show... Reminds me of the chemistry of Doc and Marty Mcfly from the Back to the Future series with a rated R twist. Slowly but surely the are tweaking character development. Getting better every new episode!!! I like the way Rick is always drinking and burping and slurring his speech. This show is getting a lot of acclaim with so few episodes and it deserves every bit. Honestly this is the best cartoons aimed at young adults and teens that I've seen in a years. I always get excited when I see a new episode trailer!!! Can't wait to see what direction they take this to in the future. They have set it up for literally limitless possibilities."
"34",NA,"superthuginc","Mar 23, 2014",10,"This show is excellent",NA,"I just finished watching the first three episodes and feel instantly hooked. I have the same feeling I had when I watched Family Guy for the first time, in which I felt like every single character was interesting and was contributing for the series in their own ways. In this show, things that will make you laugh are dark and awkward at times which succeed every time. I haven't found a single bad moment so far in the first three episodes and can't wait to watch the whole thing The first episode was awesome and got me straight to the next. The dog world domination episode is going to be a classic, go watch it. People will remember that episode."
"35",NA,"fruhz","Dec 22, 2013",9,"The Best New Adult Animated Series Around",NA,"Rick and Morty is a very funny show. The humor is crazy and is hurled at the audience with breathless speed. Every joke doesn't hit, but there are so many of them that it hardly matters, and when they do hit, they hit hard.That makes it a good show, but what makes it a truly great series is the intelligence of the crazy sci-fi ideas that fuel the stories. Yes, a miniverse inside a miniverse inside a miniverse is ridiculous, but it's also wonderfully ingenious, especially as you see both the variety and consistency of these worlds. A being that insinuates itself into everyone's memories was beautifully done. An episode in which your mind can create your concept of your partner was smart from the beginning, but then kept expanding on the idea.Every idea is nonsensical, but every idea is ingenious and fully explored. This is not just good comedy, it's good sci-fi.I wish this show had lasted as long as the Simpsons (i.e. forever) but what there is is fantastic."
"36",NA,"cherold","Nov 8, 2016",9,"Funny and wonderfully ingenious",NA,"I find the Rick and Morty series are good to watch in the background, and jump in at any moment. Even though there is a story to follow in the lore throughout the episodes and seasons, it isn't 100% necessary to watch them in order and to know what is going on. This is because each of the episodes follow a short story/adventure that mainly follows Rick and Morty however sometimes there will be a combination of characters in the adventure.I enjoy thé creativity of the show, as the premise of the show follows Rick, a Scientific genius who developed portal travel and other interesting Si-Fi gadgets, and because of this, anything can happen and the stories can run wild. I have watched this a few times however I find that I always like the very different adventures from episode to episode.One thing that is seen underlying in the show which I think is done very well is the character development and their interaction with one another. From Beth and Jerry's failing marriage to Ricks sense of depression, pushing people away and loneliness. This sort of character lore provides something a bit extra for the viewer and sometimes can allow some relation between the characters and the viewer."
"37",NA,"liamgriffith-12694","Apr 5, 2023",8,"Entertaining Stories with interesting character development",NA,"Scratch that. This may be the best Cartoon Network show period! Yeah, you don't normally group Adult Swim shows with other ones, but as someone who watches both, this is freaking awesome! The funniest thing is how I was introduced to this series. I was actually recommended by a friend at work to see it. I looked here on the IMDb and found out it had the highest rating of any animated show (not including anime) that I'd ever seen! And you know what? I think it completely deserves it.Apart from having good animation, the characters and stories in this show are just so freaking fun. Every single character is dysfunctional in some way, but never to the point where they're unlikeable. Rick of course steals the show. I believe it when I hear that Rick represents a cynical part of our personalities and Morty is the idealistic one. The fact that both of these characters are voiced by Justin Roiland makes it all the more obvious. I keep expecting Morty to say ""Unacceptable!"" at any time. I kept wondering who this guy was and why I kept hearing him in every cartoon I was watching.I have yet to find a single episode of this show I didn't like. Then again, the show hasn't gone on that long and I haven't seen all the episodes. I think my favorite is probably ""Lawnmower Dogs"". The two plots are so good and hilarious. Anything with Scary Terry is amusing. What sets this apart from lesser shows like ""Family Guy"" is that this show does work so much harder to make you laugh and doesn't try to just gross you out. It really does focus on character development and takes time to make jokes relevant to the story. It's still not quite as good as ""South Park"" but it's fairly close in terms of adult cartoons. I think my former favorite Adult Swim show was ""Robot Chicken"" or perhaps ""The Venture Bros."".There's quite a lot of variety in Rick and Morty's adventures. There's quite a bit of creativity. There even are some truly heartwarming moments. I can always count on this to make me laugh or entertain me in any way. This just succeeds where so many adult cartoons have failed as they try to hard to be obscene or just aren't funny. The plot? Well, not really much except Rick travels through space and other dimensions with his grandson, Morty. The vocal range is great and it's nice and colorful.Watch this show and laugh like mad. Perfect ****!"

I think this was the best animation I have seen in the last few years!This animation shines in every episode! Each episode is a strange and interesting adventure
But honestly, if you spend at least twenty minutes of your time watching this animation every day, of course! If you look at it as temporary entertainment, you'll definitely be satisfied, but if you want to watch it as an animation with a fixed and determined theme, I don't think you'll be satisfied.But it actually makes me happy to know that there are other parts of it that I haven't seen yet!This encourages me a lot to support

But it's as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven't seen one since a long time! That's what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it's great. Keep up the good workPS.: I hope they take one or two scientists on board to help them with Grandpa Rick to keep him on track regarding scientific accuracy. But that'S just a personnel tic of mine..."

Mainly because of the fantastic writing, unique plots, trippy Lo-fi feeling animation, and it was funny. Genuinely, I think it was a creative juggernaut.But now, the show has lost sight of its characters, the jokes feel like they're rehashing ideas, and the whole atmosphere of the show has shifted. It doesn't feel like a show made out of love anymore, it feels like a corporate product, leaning heavily into what they think made it popular while completely misunderstanding what made it popular. The show doesn't take risks anymore, it just repeats the same boring idea again and again with no creativity in it.I think the show lost the magic it was born with, and now it's just a husk of what it once was. The emotional aspects fall flat, the drama feels forced, the comedy is tried and tired.I recommend the first two seasons, anything afterwards is completely up to you, I didn't like it at all and I'm not going to watch season 7 whenever it comes out. I'm dropping this show for good.Solar Opposites on the other hand..."

This series was my first foray into the world of FMA, & I must say, it is VERY excellent.First off, the series has a huge cast of interesting & unique characters. They are each quite different from each other, and act in different ways. The way the series elegantly manages all the character's developments and story lines is a feat in itself. The series also has a fantastically crafted plot, filled with action, humor, & tragedy. Despite its mainstream appeal, it still maintains a mature tone that really grabs you.The animation & art is top notch. You won't be getting any poorly edited sequences or grotesque looking art. The production values are great. I watched the series with the English voice track, and the dub did quite a good job. No complaints there. The soundtrack is excellent as well, particularly the opening & closing sequences that accompany each episode.It goes on for some 64 episodes, & maintains your attention the entire time.

Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist? With hesitation and doubt in my heart I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show. I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic ""in those days, we really believed..."" lines from Al. With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open. Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had. If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better. Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out."

"47",NA,"cadillac20","Dec 6, 2009",9,"Just might be the perfect mainstream series",NA,"Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."

Finally I decided to watch it.At first I was kinda disappointed. The first few episodes didn't make a huge impression on me. But as the story progressed and I got to know more and more fantastically written characters, the backstory started to unfold and alchemy expanded, it just got better and better.At a point I suddenly found myself addicted to the show. When one episode finished, I immediately started playing the next. The story deals with morally heavy themes. There is some seriously dark stuff in there. But there is also light. Once you experience terrible things in this show, it is truly cathartic to see some hearthwarmingly good things unfold as well.This show will make you feel very deep feelings. I have to admit to be crying at some points. It is a true roller-coaster.You will get so attached to the characters that after the series is over you will seriously miss them. That is a quality of a great show.The scope of the story is bigger than anything I have ever seen before (no joking, the stakes are bigger than in any other fantasy / sci-fi). You will find yourself truly rooting for the good guys, worrying about them, and cheering when they seem to succeed in combat against a foe.If you want to be amazed, addicted, emotionally lifted, press the start button on this show."

I could probably list at least 50 full series I've seen from all kinds.If i told myself 10 years ago or so that the best series i would ever see was an Anime i wouldn't have believed it.This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is little to none loose ends. There isn't a ""stormy"" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good.The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate (Lost *cough*) or to fast story.All characters are developed in a brilliant way through the series.Of all movies and shows I've seen in my lifetime - if i would have to recommend one single series to someone it would be this one without hesitation.If i had an enemy i hated in real life more than anything - even i wouldn't be so cruel as to deny that person to see this show. I could deny them food instead and it would be merciful. Thats how good this show is.One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying.This is one of the only shows I've ever seen, where i haven't been able to personally come up with better ideas on how to make it.Perfection.See it.I also recommend original Japanese voices with English text for best experience."

I've always been a fan of the Manga, and the new series is being based completely of the manga storyline. This had be hooked, so i waited nervously for the first episode.The new series features better artwork that resembles Arakawa's style more closely than the last series. There is more humour, especially Ed transmuting a spear-head into his face. There is a new soundtrack, which admittedly, at times doesn't work greatly, but with some getting used too, i'm sure it will grow on me. Overall, i feel this series is a fantastic reboot, and is verging on turning Fullmetal Alchemist into the series it should always have been."
"55",NA,"Kentvaroy","Sep 16, 2010",8,"Pretty much the best show made in the history of mankind",NA,"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.The second version (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) is sticking to manga and has the soul of the original story. It is an all-rounded anime with tightly knit fantastic story, humorous, action packed, dark at times and entertaining. In first half, character introduction, funny moments, action sequence, ends with almost no hope situation for our heroes. In second half, the story takes it's fast pace with more action and nail biting moments.The decisions/resolutions taken by the Elric brothers at each step of their journey are clearly justified. All characters had their importance in the series, even the cute little panda and Yogi had their importance in moving the story forward. Usually when a character is introduced in the middle of a series, it stay far too superior/inferior to rest of the characters. But I like the way Olivier Mira Armstrong and Lin Yao gang introduced in the series.Sometimes when I think of watching something, I start with any one particular scene in this series and ended up watching till the very end of the series. I don't remember how many times I watched it.I have seen many anime in all genre (comedy, drama, action, adventure, thriller, slice of life, bloody ones, etc.) and in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best in overall. So I give 10 out of 10.When people asks me to suggest something to watch, I recommend this series without blinking. Either they say Animation is for kids or series are lengthy to watch without knowing how Japanese anime differs from Western animation. I would say one thing, watch at least couple of episodes and then you will understand why I recommend this series.Suggestion: The first episode is more of an quick introduction of main casts. The actual story starts in episode 2. So it is OK to skip episode 1. Japanese audio is better than English audio.Other suggested Animes: Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Code Geass, Steins Gate, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titans, Samurai Champloo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Parasyte, One Punch Man (season 1), Boku no Hero Academia, Ghost in the shell (both movies & series, have complex plot), Shigurui (only adults, watch only if you are OK with violence & sex)"
"56",NA,"garethwatkin","Apr 13, 2009",9,"A Fantastic Reboot",NA,"First let me say that the music/OSTs in this anime are just magnificent, there is not even one single bad opening! Every opening them is just so perfect that you can't stop listening to it! The background music is so goated! My favorite op is the 5th op ""Rain"" by SID and it's actually my all time favorite anime op, the greatest opening ever. But other than that the ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" story about two brothers and their journey to try to get their bodies back is a perfect storytelling, with a great writing to every character and a really good characters design and a nice world building plus a fine animation. Something that I really like about this anime is that how they show you all this things about the military and how you can't trust people no matter who they are and all this thing with the dogs of the military etc... I also like the philosophy in this anime but I don't want to say too much here, so if you really wanna know what I'm talking about search on YouTube ""The Philosophy of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" there is a video there by ""Wisecrack"", I recommend you to watch it if you've already finished the anime."
"57",NA,"spookycostume","Aug 19, 2011",10,"Equivalent Exchange - Give time to  watch = Pleasure out of it",NA,"I've always been a fan of anime that blend intricate storytelling with well-developed characters, and ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" didn't disappoint. This series, adapted from the manga by Hiromu Arakawa, is often hailed as a masterpiece, and while I found it compelling, I had my reservations.The story revolves around two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use alchemy to try and bring their mother back from the dead but pay a terrible price. Edward loses his arm and leg while Alphonse's entire body is taken, leaving his soul bound to a suit of armor. The brothers embark on a journey to find the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary artifact that can restore their bodies.The narrative is the strongest aspect of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood."" The plot is intricate, filled with political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and complex character relationships. It doesn't shy away from exploring the consequences of seeking power and the toll it takes on individuals and society. The themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the value of human life are woven into the story's fabric.The character development is impressive, especially for the Elric brothers. Edward's determination and resilience are inspiring, and his unwavering commitment to protecting his loved ones makes him a compelling protagonist. Alphonse's struggle with identity and the meaning of existence adds depth to his character. The supporting cast is diverse, each with their own motivations and arcs, though some side characters could have been more fleshed out.The animation quality by Studio Bones is consistent throughout the series, with fluid action sequences and detailed character designs. The alchemical battles are a visual spectacle, showcasing the versatility of alchemy in combat.However, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" has its flaws. The pacing, particularly in the earlier episodes, can be slow, and the series assumes viewers have seen the 2003 adaptation or read the manga, resulting in some rushed character introductions and world-building. The humor, while occasionally amusing, can feel out of place in the midst of the story's darker themes.The climax and resolution of the series, while emotionally satisfying, left me wanting more closure for certain characters and plotlines. Some questions remained unanswered, which was a bit frustrating.In conclusion, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is a memorable and thought-provoking anime that explores complex themes and boasts well-rounded characters. While it has its share of pacing issues and unanswered questions, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. I rate it 7/10 because it offers a captivating journey through a richly crafted world of alchemy, ethics, and the enduring bonds of brotherhood."

At the beginning I was excited for the journey and the world building. The concept of alchemy and the story of the brothers seemed promising. As the show progressed I honestly just couldn't care less for any character. It feels like the protagonists just like to fight just because. The story could have been told in a lot less episodes. The music was mediocre in my opinion first opening was fairly good but nothing memorable. Humor was funny but really overused!!I'll try watching the 2003 version.

Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."

The characters grow and develop, the cast is amazing and also is one of the rare Shounens anime that have indeed good female characters, story started simple but grows in a amazing and addictive way.

Finally I decided to watch it.At first I was kinda disappointed. The first few episodes didn't make a huge impression on me. But as the story progressed and I got to know more and more fantastically written characters, the backstory started to unfold and alchemy expanded, it just got better and better.At a point I suddenly found myself addicted to the show. When one episode finished, I immediately started playing the next. The story deals with morally heavy themes. There is some seriously dark stuff in there. But there is also light. Once you experience terrible things in this show, it is truly cathartic to see some hearthwarmingly good things unfold as well.This show will make you feel very deep feelings. I have to admit to be crying at some points. It is a true roller-coaster.You will get so attached to the characters that after the series is over you will seriously miss them. That is a quality of a great show.The scope of the story is bigger than anything I have ever seen before (no joking, the stakes are bigger than in any other fantasy / sci-fi). You will find yourself truly rooting for the good guys, worrying about them, and cheering when they seem to succeed in combat against a foe.If you want to be amazed, addicted, emotionally lifted, press the start button on this show."

The series has a sizable cast which are unique and interesting in their own way. They all have specific characteristics which make them stand out from each other and sometimes oppose each other with their philosophies. This series does things that may others attempt to do. They manage to develop the characters and their story lines in a very beautiful manner. This series has one of the best plots that I have ever witnessed with just the right amount of action, humour and tragedy all excellently blended together to create a plot that keeps you wanting more from start to finish."

"73",NA,"TripHawkin","Oct 12, 2022",10,"Fantastic.",NA,"Ill explain why this is the best series ever made and why i feel worthy of judging that.*Note that English isn't my native tongue* I've been addicted to series for like... forever. I could probably list at least 50 full series I've seen from all kinds.If i told myself 10 years ago or so that the best series i would ever see was an Anime i wouldn't have believed it.This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is little to none loose ends. There isn't a ""stormy"" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good.The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate (Lost *cough*) or to fast story.All characters are developed in a brilliant way through the series.Of all movies and shows I've seen in my lifetime - if i would have to recommend one single series to someone it would be this one without hesitation.If i had an enemy i hated in real life more than anything - even i wouldn't be so cruel as to deny that person to see this show. I could deny them food instead and it would be merciful. Thats how good this show is.One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying.This is one of the only shows I've ever seen, where i haven't been able to personally come up with better ideas on how to make it.Perfection.See it.I also recommend original Japanese voices with English text for best experience."
"74",NA,"ppochlon03","Jul 19, 2011",10,"The Best Anime Ever",NA,"Having been an avid fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist series, i was highly apprehensive on hearing about this reboot, but the more i found out about the series, the more excited i became. I've always been a fan of the Manga, and the new series is being based completely of the manga storyline. This had be hooked, so i waited nervously for the first episode.The new series features better artwork that resembles Arakawa's style more closely than the last series. There is more humour, especially Ed transmuting a spear-head into his face. There is a new soundtrack, which admittedly, at times doesn't work greatly, but with some getting used too, i'm sure it will grow on me. Overall, i feel this series is a fantastic reboot, and is verging on turning Fullmetal Alchemist into the series it should always have been."
"75",NA,"Kentvaroy","Sep 16, 2010",8,"Pretty much the best show made in the history of mankind",NA,"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.The second version (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) is sticking to manga and has the soul of the original story. It is an all-rounded anime with tightly knit fantastic story, humorous, action packed, dark at times and entertaining. In first half, character introduction, funny moments, action sequence, ends with almost no hope situation for our heroes. In second half, the story takes it's fast pace with more action and nail biting moments.The decisions/resolutions taken by the Elric brothers at each step of their journey are clearly justified. All characters had their importance in the series, even the cute little panda and Yogi had their importance in moving the story forward. Usually when a character is introduced in the middle of a series, it stay far too superior/inferior to rest of the characters. But I like the way Olivier Mira Armstrong and Lin Yao gang introduced in the series.Sometimes when I think of watching something, I start with any one particular scene in this series and ended up watching till the very end of the series. I don't remember how many times I watched it.I have seen many anime in all genre (comedy, drama, action, adventure, thriller, slice of life, bloody ones, etc.) and in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best in overall. So I give 10 out of 10.When people asks me to suggest something to watch, I recommend this series without blinking. Either they say Animation is for kids or series are lengthy to watch without knowing how Japanese anime differs from Western animation. I would say one thing, watch at least couple of episodes and then you will understand why I recommend this series.Suggestion: The first episode is more of an quick introduction of main casts. The actual story starts in episode 2. So it is OK to skip episode 1. Japanese audio is better than English audio.Other suggested Animes: Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Code Geass, Steins Gate, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titans, Samurai Champloo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Parasyte, One Punch Man (season 1), Boku no Hero Academia, Ghost in the shell (both movies & series, have complex plot), Shigurui (only adults, watch only if you are OK with violence & sex)"
"76",NA,"garethwatkin","Apr 13, 2009",9,"A Fantastic Reboot",NA,"First let me say that the music/OSTs in this anime are just magnificent, there is not even one single bad opening! Every opening them is just so perfect that you can't stop listening to it! The background music is so goated! My favorite op is the 5th op ""Rain"" by SID and it's actually my all time favorite anime op, the greatest opening ever. But other than that the ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" story about two brothers and their journey to try to get their bodies back is a perfect storytelling, with a great writing to every character and a really good characters design and a nice world building plus a fine animation. Something that I really like about this anime is that how they show you all this things about the military and how you can't trust people no matter who they are and all this thing with the dogs of the military etc... I also like the philosophy in this anime but I don't want to say too much here, so if you really wanna know what I'm talking about search on YouTube ""The Philosophy of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" there is a video there by ""Wisecrack"", I recommend you to watch it if you've already finished the anime."
"77",NA,"spookycostume","Aug 19, 2011",10,"Equivalent Exchange - Give time to  watch = Pleasure out of it",NA,"I've always been a fan of anime that blend intricate storytelling with well-developed characters, and ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" didn't disappoint. This series, adapted from the manga by Hiromu Arakawa, is often hailed as a masterpiece, and while I found it compelling, I had my reservations.The story revolves around two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use alchemy to try and bring their mother back from the dead but pay a terrible price. Edward loses his arm and leg while Alphonse's entire body is taken, leaving his soul bound to a suit of armor. The brothers embark on a journey to find the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary artifact that can restore their bodies.The narrative is the strongest aspect of ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood."" The plot is intricate, filled with political intrigue, moral dilemmas, and complex character relationships. It doesn't shy away from exploring the consequences of seeking power and the toll it takes on individuals and society. The themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the value of human life are woven into the story's fabric.The character development is impressive, especially for the Elric brothers. Edward's determination and resilience are inspiring, and his unwavering commitment to protecting his loved ones makes him a compelling protagonist. Alphonse's struggle with identity and the meaning of existence adds depth to his character. The supporting cast is diverse, each with their own motivations and arcs, though some side characters could have been more fleshed out.The animation quality by Studio Bones is consistent throughout the series, with fluid action sequences and detailed character designs. The alchemical battles are a visual spectacle, showcasing the versatility of alchemy in combat.However, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" has its flaws. The pacing, particularly in the earlier episodes, can be slow, and the series assumes viewers have seen the 2003 adaptation or read the manga, resulting in some rushed character introductions and world-building. The humor, while occasionally amusing, can feel out of place in the midst of the story's darker themes.The climax and resolution of the series, while emotionally satisfying, left me wanting more closure for certain characters and plotlines. Some questions remained unanswered, which was a bit frustrating.In conclusion, ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" is a memorable and thought-provoking anime that explores complex themes and boasts well-rounded characters. While it has its share of pacing issues and unanswered questions, its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. I rate it 7/10 because it offers a captivating journey through a richly crafted world of alchemy, ethics, and the enduring bonds of brotherhood."

This is the definition of overhype and hyped up just because others like it and I can't believe people compare this with shows such as Avatar the Last Airbender or Attack on Titan. At the beginning I was excited for the journey and the world building. The concept of alchemy and the story of the brothers seemed promising. As the show progressed I honestly just couldn't care less for any character. It feels like the protagonists just like to fight just because. The story could have been told in a lot less episodes. The music was mediocre in my opinion first opening was fairly good but nothing memorable. Humor was funny but really overused!!I'll try watching the 2003 version. Overall I do not recommend this show. Watch ATLA, AOT, Death Note, Hunter x Hunter or Code Geass instead.Peace:)"

What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad"

It's so painful to accept it for the audience who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then finishing it like this! It's a long long journey.

However, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, I was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine.

"89",NA,"tweaknhoe","May 25, 2019",8,"Why just why? This show could have been the best ever.",NA,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to.

I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone."
"99",NA,"psypeterson","Apr 16, 2011",10,"Excellent adaptation.",NA,"Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""Merlin"" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."

But once I started watching it, I couldn't stop.
It became more and more exciting from season 1-8.Great actors.I was disappointed with the end of the 8 season!"
